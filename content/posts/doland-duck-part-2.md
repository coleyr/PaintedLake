Overnight the town's water export industry ground to a halt. Orders went unfilled and began piling up. Letters came from as far away as the capital with eventually even the governor demanding answers. But the town had none.

The hydrant was just gone. Irwin Bledsoe had shown up to start the day's water collection only to find an empty spot surrounded by 50 to-be-filled barrels.  No one had ever thought to post a guard on free water.

For a few weeks all seemed lost.  The town had recently invested heavily in their water export infrastructure and bills were coming due along with the need to decide on whether to start cancelling and refunding their customers.  Search parties had been sent out.  A few less trusting town folk had snuck into other towns in the county or across state lines to see if a rival had stolen it.  More than one fist fight or brawl at a Ladies Auxiliary bake sale had broken out in neighboring towns.

All looked lost when suddenly on a misty November night Cohen Duck (still 'Duke') had again fallen over the hydrant and broken his leg only this time it had appeared on the outskirts of town in a small glen.  Again Cohen suffered a night of chills and pointless yelling but when the dawn came and brought his sleepy-eyed rescuers now Cohen Doland Duck was a hero.

And so it had been ever since.  Periodically, the hydrant would disappear.  Cohen then eventually one of his sons, then grandsons would break a leg falling over the newly re-appeared hydrant and it would be back to business as usual for the town and its water export business.

No one knew why the hydrant always had water to give or why it moved from time to time.  No one knew or really cared why a Duck boy had to break a leg to get the town back on its feet.  And until that fateful day in July, no one knew that Cohen Doland Duck VI's life was going to change courtesy of Michelle.

When municipal water exports evolved into bottled water selling in the 30s, the Ducks held positions of minor power on the Board of the new Water company.  Mostly they were there so the Board and the town representatives could make sure there was always a male Duck in the pipeline and that he was named "Cohen Doland Duck" (still pronounced...).  Some few might consider it municipally-sanctioned prostitution the way girls were practically thrown at the Ducks until a male heir was proven to be on the way.  But those some few knew to keep their mouths shut and check their moral lines at the door.
