Most continuous conversations of excitement have an interplay where one party feeds of another and both urge the other on. Ellory and Michael's conversation sparked towards one topic and then slowing on another. Ellory loved to talk about herself, though she often didn't in daily conversation. "How many siblings do you have?" Michael asked "Just me" Ellory said both thumbs extending from closed fist towards a goofy pose. Michael knew this already from preliminary research but he thought it might tell him something about how she felt about being an only child.

"If you could have one super power what would it be?" Michael had often used this question to get to know people, super powers are a fantastic notion but even the most hardened adult glimpses some whimsy about super speed or strength. This marked the end of the formal fact finding mission. Michael had six hard dates to visit in Ellory's past. One: When her Grandfather died.

Two: Her parents divorce, the worst of came when her mother found the notes Charles had written. She held the family's lab and sobbed on the floor. "It was hard. I wanted to be mad but I kept getting choked up. It feels silly, and I hate that cause it was really bad, but I felt like I couldn't think about long, I would try to think of something nice then I would be reminded that my family is kinda not there." Ellory said kind of slumped in her chair.

Three: Zoe the lab's death. "She was kind and dumb and had the custest little way of putting her head on your lap. I remember her crawling towards me when I was upset as a kid hiding underneath my bed. She scooted next to me and just lay there. It was nice." Ellory's eyes watered and she smiled a bit thinking of her companion.

Four:The entire fourth grade, Ellory was bullied for having glasses that year and her mother decided to homeschool her for most of the year. Ellory remembers looking out the window as the kids got on the bus. "I made a lot of art that year and took apart my bike several times. It still feels like it might still be going on the way the days dragged on."

Five: Summer. The summer between Ellory's Freshman and Sophomore year her ex BFF told her she didn't want to see her ever again. Ellory had remained and Frankie became cool and relevant. Ellory liked dorky jokes and comfortable clothes and Frankie liked the way other people looked at her and thought about her. They were close, ever since T ball in the first grade. When Frankie didn't want to go to camp because she was scared Ellory put her hand on her shoulder and offered to be her tent mate. Now Frankie makes fun of girl scouts. Ellory cried, when Frankie standing with Jake Markobs and Stefanie Sims pointed to Ellory's dirty shoes and unkempt hair and said "You know if you are overweight you got to work extra hard" Michael made a note to find out all the times Frankie skipped class and tip of Tom the Security Guard who loved busting punk kids.

Finally six: Something unknown. Ellory hadn't said anything in particular but something in between her words made Michael feel like there was another specific time Ellory needed someone and he was going to find it!
