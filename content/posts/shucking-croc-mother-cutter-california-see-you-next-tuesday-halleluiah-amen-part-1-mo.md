E. Longstreet had one goal in life.  His entire life people had told him--mostly his parents--to wait until he was 18 for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.  Learning to drive?  18.  Cursing? 18.  Going on a date?  18.  Choosing his own clothes?  18.  Joining the Boy Scouts?  18 (he could be a Scout Master, they said, a Scout Master!!)

E. Longstreet was a patient kid but inside he seethed with barely controlled anticipation. As long as he could remember he had lain awake at night planning his 18th birthday.  When he was younger it had been stupid things, childish things, really.  At midnight, he would storm into his parents' room and announce that he was done with vegetables and beans.  They could take those and shove them in their pie holes--he wanted a steak.  Rare!  Maybe he would just bite a cow.  And pie! Yes, pie, beautiful pies and cakes and candies and sweets.  He was going to build a fountain of chocolate and wheel it into their rooms and lay on the floor and drink it dry.  E. Longstreet would have a cow drag in the fountain and E. Longstreet would drink his chocolate and bite his cow and his father, Quinten Longstreet, dentist, would not be able to do a thing about it.  Because E. would be 18.

By the time, E. was 10 he had put aside such childish fantasies.  Now, he his plan was to stroll into his parent room at midnight, but he would say every curse word he knew.  All of them.  There were a lot.  E. had been journaling.  Every time he wanted to curse he would go to his room and write down the curse words he wanted to say.  For a time he dabbled in dirty jokes and naughty limericks, too, but at 13 he had scrapped those.  He had seven spiral-bound notebooks of curse words and by his calculations reading all of those to his parents would flow well into breakfast, maybe lunch.  So he had torn out the dirty jokes and the limericks.  He had restructured and revised his lists, removed duplicates, corrected the grammar of certain phrases, made a few edits, etc.  His first journal was mostly scrapped.  What passed for curse words at 7 was laughable at thirteen.  Plus there were a lot of drawings of unicorns and stick figure superheroes and an entire page full of writing so tiny it was impossible to read.

At 15, the journals had begun to gather events, too.  He WOULD kiss a girl--no wait, he would but not in his parent's room, in front of them.  That would be weird.  But after his non-stop cursing monologue he would walk out his front door, pee on a bush, pet a strange dog, buy a pack of cigarettes, then stop the first mildly attractive female he could find and give her a full, open mouth, on-the-lips, tonsil tickle.

At 16, he had stopped journaling.  E. Longstreet was what people called a "late bloomer".  One night as he was committing to memory a few pages of curse words he began to actually think about what the words meant.  A few he had to look up but by the time he was done he was dumbfounded.  He pulled out his math books and flipped to the chapters on statistics and probabilities.  A few hours later, E. Longstreet sat back and shook his head softly.  He stared up at his collection of curse word journals on his bookshelf.  96.4% of the words and phrases in them had to do with s-e-x.  Some of them were direct references, some were descriptions, some were s-e-x with....things E. Longstreet had no context or reference for.  He suspected that it might even be 98% because he suspected some things had double meanings.  All of it, everything he had wanted to say when he turned 18, it was just about copulation with a woman...or man, or farm animal, or a series of inanimate objects that E. Longstreet may or may not have heard of before or if he had he could not imagine exactly how it was used in sex.

He felt cheated.  E. Longstreet lost something precious on that night of dirty words and math.

His parents and teachers chalked up his depression to typical teenage angst and hormones.  He was a good boy.  This too would pass.  But for E. Longstreet the world had become a gray, tiresome thing; every word he spoke, every morsel of food that crossed his lips was like ash in his mouth (he had scratched "smoke a cigarette" off his Day-I-Turn-18 List that year).  How could so much of the color of English language be centered around...s-e-x.

At 17, SHE moved in. Ms. Netherregion---Ms. Netane had moved in next door.  She was a hot piec...a house wife, a house wife.  A former house wife actually.  Now, she was a divorcee who had left her big swinging di---left her husband, probably because he liked to...things had not worked out.  E. Longstreet had run into Ms. Nice Bottom--literally run into her--the day she was moving in.  His mother had sent E. Longstreet over with a pie (Come on!  The new neighbor gets a pie?!?), a quiche, and a tub of homemade spaghetti.  E. had been trying to manage/juggle his mother's welcome gifts and Ms. NeeditNow had been unloading a box from her trunk.  E. was hurrying to make it back before his favorite TV show started when he came around the corner of his house and slammed into his new neighbor.  She went down, the box she had been carrying went flying, and half of E.'s load went flying.

"Ow!" she said.

E., who had barely managed to maintain his balance and hold onto the spaghetti and quiche, looked down...and saw an angel.  Actually, he saw an angle, not angel.  The angle being right up Ms. NoNoSquare's skirt which was now tangled over her head.  His jaw dropped and he quickly looked away.  And then back.  Then away.  Then back one more time and then away.  Quick glance.  One more.  Then ashamed E. forced his eyes over to her bush--the hedge, the hedge in front of Ms. SpankMeSilly's house.

"Hey, help a lady up?"

E. carefully looked over.  Ms. SpankMyMonkeyTilTheSheepSleep had gotten her skirt down, though not past those creamy white--stop it, just stop it!

Ms. Naugh---Netane!  Ms. Netane had her hand extended and she was waiting for E. to take it and help her up.  E. set down his mother's gifts and helped the woman up, his eyes darting away from her ample, would we call it ample, okay ample bosom as it passed within his view.

"I am Lana," she said.  "What have you got packing down there, Mister?"

"What did you say?" E. asked, taking a step back.

The woman took a step back also.  "Uh, I said my name is Lana," she said slowly.

"Habab hababa hababa," E. said.  "Hmmna hmmna."

"Are you all right?  Did you hit your head on the trunk or--"

"Habab hababa hababa," E. said more urgently, trying to get his words to something intelligible.  "Hmmna hmmna."

The woman--who was maybe 25, maybe 28, maybe 30, which was not that far from 17, really, took another step back, eyeing E. warily.  "Do you...live around here...?"

E. looked at her then immediately down at his own feet.  "Neighbor!" he yelled, cringing at his blundering attempt at communication. "Me neighbors you."

"Oh," the woman said.  She nodded. "Great.  Just great," she muttered.

"Food, food.  Mom sent food.  To you," E. said pointing at the pie, face down on the ground and then holding out the spaghetti and quiche to the woman. What is wrong with me? he thought. He had never felt so...feverish.

The woman knelt down and picked up the pie carefully.  She managed to save most of it and smiled up at him.  "I bet you'd like to have me bent over like 6:30."  She stood up and smiled. E. Swayed slightly. She did not say that.  She did not say that. E. shook his head. I am going crazy.  Crazy.  Crazy. Crazy! "Are you sure," Ms. MileHighClub asked.  She put a finger in her mouth and sucked on it.  "That is definitely apple."  E. stared at the finger that had disappeared in--

"Okay, fine," he said quickly, tearing his eyes away.

The woman who was E.'s new neighbor and not a sex goddess come to rock his world turned around and bent over to pick up her box.  "How do you like my nice, tight ass?" she said.

"Bababababababbaa!" E. said before he managed to bite his lip to stop himself.

The woman who was not wearing a chainmail bikini because who would wear something like that in this heat spun around.  "Ahh, why don't you leave those right there.  I would invite you in--"

"No!" E. yelled.

"But," the woman who had dark brown eyes said quickly, "the place is a mess.  So leave those there.  Right there.  And tell your mom, Mrs...?"

"Longwang--Longstreet!" E. said.  "Her name is LongDongStreet.  Street.  Longstreet."

Another buxom hard bod---another woman, just a woman, in a pair of jeans and a half opened blouse that---A WOMAN, JUST A WOMAN, it was just a gosh darn woman.  And she came out of the front door.  "Lana, do you want to take off your clothes and make out with me?  And bring this stud?"

E. shuddered and squeezed his eyes closed.  He tried to block out all of the words running through his mind.  Pounding at his teeth, trying to get out into the world.  The women were gropin--talking.  They were speaking words out of those flippin' gosh darn mouths.  E. wanted to cry.

"I think he's the neighbor's kid who sent some food.  I think he might be...special."

"Ahhhh," said the second female, of which 50% of the population of the world was including his mother, so what's the big flippin' deal?

E. put the spaghetti and quiche down on the ground.  "Nice to meet you both!  Two!  There's two!" he screamed and then he ran back to his house.  He wrenched the front door open and ran inside, slamming it behind him.  By the time he got to his bedroom the tears were flowing freely.  He was so angry.  He wanted to break something.  He picked up the first thing that came to hand: a 4th grade spelling bee trophy.  But he had worked hard to get that.  Almost as hard as he wanted to work, Ms.---nope, nope, nope!  E. carefully put down trophy.  He knew what he had to do.  He reached for an empty journal, opened it and took a deep breath.  He picked up a pen and wrote:

"I, E. Longstreet, want to..."

By the time he dropped off to sleep he had filled 2/3 of the journal and slept the peaceful sleep of a man who exorcised his demons.

And E. had been right.  That night of frantic writing had opened and emptied a well of emotions he never consciously realized had built up over the years.  He had met Ms. Netane again--luckily with his mother there this time, otherwise Ms. Netane probably would have barred her door and called the police or maybe a mental institution.  But with a few more meetings, a dinner at the Longstreets for a few of the other neighbors to meet Ms. Netane (she's a divorcee, did you know?), all of that horrible day became water under the bridge.  By some unspoken collective agreement, Ms. Netane and E. agreed never, ever to speak of that day.
