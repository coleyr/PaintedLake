There was a long, tense moment where Harry thought Arthur might do it; that he might stomp down on his hand. Instead Arthur knelt down and sat beside him. He pulled out a flask and took a pull off of it. He set it down in front of Harry’s still outstretched hand. “I would say not,” Arthur said softly. Harry took the flask and sat up. He took a sip. It was a decent scotch and it burned comfortably as it went down. He took a long pull. “You brought her? She was…with you?” Harry asked tentatively. Arthur caught the tone in his voice and shook his head. “Yes with me. No, not with me. The two of you—“ “I have been meaning to call on her," Harry said quickly.  "Why was she in New York?” Arthur looked at him as if he was trying to consider whether or not to slug Harry again.  He snatched his flask back, took a pull and capped it off.

"She lives here now," Arthur stood up and offered Harry a hand.

"You have not hit me in a while like that, Doyle," Harry said, letting his friend pull him up.

"You have not needed it in a while like that, Harry," Arthur smiled slightly.  "Blame it on the vase and a boxer's pride."

"I will burn the vase tonight or have...ah, the new girl do it," Harry said.

Arthur picked up the coat rack from the floor where he had knocked it earlier during his rant.  He pulled a hat and coat off and inspected them for damage.  "The girl.  Are you with her?"

Harry shook his head.  "Not...really."  Arthur gave him a sour look but said nothing.  Moral aggrandizement was not his style.

"You should call on, Bess.  I will have my man bring her address around to you."

Harry sat in the chair in front of his makeup mirror.  He gave his face a critical look, turning his head from side to side.

Arthur put on his coat and hat and gave Harry a rye smile.  "I pulled the goddamn punches, Harry.  You are no uglier now than you were 10 minutes before."

Harry felt his jaw.  It was tender and definitely bruised but did not feel broken.

"How about a real drink?" Arthur asked.  Harry shook his head.  "Okay, Harry.  I will look you up Thursday then."

"Thursday," Harry said, smiling.  The Performer mask was in place.  Arthur paused.  He stared at Harry.

"You saw her?" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.  "Tonight."

Harry shook his head.

Arthur sighed heavily though there was relief in it.  He tossed Harry a coat and hat.  "Come on," he said.  "My man says there is a new one in town.  Black candles and a board and whispered voices.  The whole kit and caboodle apparently."

Harry touched his jaw again then stood up.  He slipped into his coat.  "I do not think you pulled either of those punches."

Arthur shrugged.  "Ask the vase."
