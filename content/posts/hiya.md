The lightning bugs hovered in the warm air pulsating in a slow rhythm. It was one of the strangest phenomena Michael took notice of moving from one place to the next, sometimes things moved like a faucet of time was turned down. No, it was more like some moments are like being in the show and others are like commercials. This bike ride felt purposed, present and full. The smell of a cigar wafting through the summer night air lingered just thickly enough Michael could almost taste it.

Riding to Ellory's house was something Michael had not done in his first childhood. But he was pretty certain he had done it a few times in memories that hadn't washed in fully yet. He had looked up the route on his computer in his dorm but the turns felt natural and he got a feeling of familiarity when he swooped under a low hanging magnolia branch. The past always felt cozier than the present and the green hue of the evening magnified the aura of summer. The sun seemed to be pinned in place just below the treeline and the trees themselves along with the grass seemed to be radiating light.

It usually took some time for Michael to adjust to an earlier self but the bike, as physiologically complex as it seems, moving pedals and balancing while steering on a narrow sidewalk, seemed to help him snap into gear. He turned hard to the left, leaning over one side of the bike, then over to the other side extending his leg to counter balance. The Schwinn bike glided up over hills and down lifting his stomach into his chest, he smiled, he forgot that used to happen.

The errand that he embarked on that night was secret. Michael made sure his parents didn't know he left the house. He had left his bike under a fir tree across the road and prepped his backpack under his bed until he was ready. All errands could be improved with an addition of clandestine behavior and a heaping pile of the excitement of getting away with something.

Today was July 10th, and Michael was determined to remove the infamy of this particular birthday. He intended to replace the memories of muffled yelling and seething words of love turned to hate. Anything would be better than what she had, but Michael thought of an ideal replacement. It was admittedly more recently on Michael's mind than Ellory's but it still seemed cool even if her childlike fascination had subsided.

Michael made the turn onto Ellory's street, oh yeah he had totally ridden this before. He hit the brakes suddenly reminded of his instructions to Ellory. He leened over and put out his kickstand then rifled through his back pack pulling out a black tee-shirt and eyeblack, which may have just been mascara on second inspection. I wonder if Ellory is actually gonna be wearing this stuff too?

Michael bent low sneaking up to the side of Ellory's house to look for her, voices could be heard inside undulating in emotion. Michael peered over the fence looking for Ellory.

"Hiya, looking for me?"

A voice called from behind. Michael turned around but didn't see anything. Ellory stepped out from behind a bush wearing a large black turtle neck and black toboggan with perfectly square eye black under her eyes. They both smiled. Michael put his finger over his mouth then pointed towards the road. Ellory walked back to the bush and picked up her bike.

"Let's ride!" Ellory whispered hunched over, walking her bike to the road.
