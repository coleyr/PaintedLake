There is something absolutely banal about salt shakers.  Sometimes they come in plastic, or glass, but ultimately they are the pawns of the dives, diners, and grease-is-a-food-group restaurants of the world... Resha stared daggers at the two demigods that she could just see through the cracked storage room door.  Humans would not have been able to see that small but she could.  And the two bastards out there slurping bad coffee could surely see her—if they bothered to look—which they hadn’t done in about 100 years. Resha was practically forgotten by her followers and now even by her jailers.  A forgotten god did not exist in the human planes.  But the diner was a nexus point, a way-station between territories.
