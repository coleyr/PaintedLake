Harry jumped to his feet.  His chair flew backwards, crashing into something.  His emotions were far from delicious now.  Thirteen hands raised and pointed a finger at him.

" Believe... "

The hands dropped and the group of men and women bowed their heads.  Then around the table people began to look around.  Most turned to look at him, but not in unison this time.  A few people shook themselves lightly.

"Harry?" Doyle said.  He stood up and walked over.  "What are you doing?"

Harry kept staring around the room.  He realized his hands were clenched into fists and willed them to relax.  He stared hard at Doyle who took an involuntary step back.

"Harry?" Doyle said carefully.  He reached out for Harry but stopped halfway to him.

Harry looked around the table at the faces.  Most regarded him with curiosity tinged with a touch of the fear you might feel at crossing paths with a rabid dog.  Harry looked at Doyle who was obviously concerned, but only at Harry's strange behavior.  Then he looked at Madame Evrelsa...and he knew.

"We will be leaving now, Arthur," Harry said.  He walked out of the room.  He heard Doyle behind him making apologies.  Harry ignored the conversation.  He noticed a door that looked like it might lead to the street and pushed it open.  It led into an alley and Harry stepped out and felt the cold air hit him.  He walked over to a garbage can and sat down heavily on it.

Doyle emerged a few moments later from the doorway.  He scanned the alleyway as he did, finding Harry but looking past him assessing the surroundings.

"You know how to make an exit, Harry," he said, sitting down on the garbage can next to Harry.  He pulled a cigar out of his jacket pocket and lit it.  He pulled a small flask from another pocket and offered it to Harry.  When Harry did not move to take it he shoved it back into his coat.

Doyle sat silently for a while and smoked.  He watched Harry carefully.  Finally, he said, "Did  you know that when I was a boy I had a terrible fear of chickens?  Vicious, little things.  Always pecking and squawking.  Peck.  Squawk.  Peck.  Squawk."

Harry stared at the wall across the alley.  After a minute he took a deep breath and smiled slightly.  "How did you get over it?"

Doyle took another puff on his cigar.  "I got more scared of elephants."

Harry held his hand out and Doyle reached into his jacket, retrieved the flask and handed it to him.  Harry took a drink but did not give it back.  He took a second drink.

"It is supposed to be mice.  Otherwise the 'elephants' does not make sense."

Doyle chuckled and then they sat in silence for while longer.

"Why did you pick that joke, Doyle?" Harry asked.

"It is Bess's joke.  Her favorite one, though she blunders it every time.  I thought it might shake you out of whatever ill humor suddenly took you."

"It is her favorite joke, but it is not her joke," Harry said softly.  He took another drink and passed the flask back.  "Odd that you would choose it just now."

Doyle shook the flask and scowled.  He tucked it back into his jacket.  "So are you going to tell me what our host, Madame Evrelsa did to insult your honor so thoroughly that you felt compelled to smash up her furniture and leave halfway through what was, by the by, turning out to be a very entertaining evening.  The young woman you scared with the spirit slate was on track to become the next Mrs. Doyle.  That was true love in there."

It was the closest Doyle would come to saying that Harry's behavior had unnerved him.

"We have to go back," Harry said.  "After the rest are gone.  We need to talk to her.  Alone if possible."

"I would prefer to go back in and find my future ex-wife."  Doyle was smiling lightly but there was an edge to his voice.  Harry realized that somehow Doyle knew also, maybe at a primal level.  He looked like a man at the mouth of a very deep cave who did not want to go it but would reluctantly if his friend did.  "She probably has already left with that fool she came with.  But I suppose we would check."

Harry stood and brushed the dirt off of his overcoat.  His hand was still shaky despite Doyle's alcohol.  He took out the bills he had been flashing at Doyle earlier in the night. "Doyle, surely you of all men realize that our dear Madame Evrelsa is the most despicable kind of charlatan."  He tossed the bills to Doyle who caught them with surprise.  He stared at them then folded them into his pocket slowly.

"This is a new development," he said softly.

"Yes," Harry said.  "She is the genuine article marauding as a fake."
