Doland had absolutely no desire to be at the Founders' Ball. He was a "guest of honor" according to his mother so attendance was not optional. His father had a very important job in the water factory that apparently Doland was supposed to inherit some day (so much for nepotism rules, Doland had thought when he heard that).

He pulled at his starched collar. His tie was practically strangling him and the collar was chafing his neck. He fully expected to see hives there when he took it off later tonight. He was just about to head over to the snack table for another bite of chocolate cake when he saw her.

Doland dropped his plate and fork at his feet then scrambled to pick it up before anyone noticed. He didn't need to worry though. Everyone was drawn to the angel in the room. Sarah entered a room and conversations stopped, people stared, boys hit puberty suddenly. She was just that beautiful. Doland had fantasized often about approaching her, extending his hand, and asking her to dance as he bowed deeply. Was it old fashioned? Yes, but couldn't a guy dream a little?

"What are you looking at?" Said a waspish voice. Doland looked around and saw his greatest fear. Michelle, Sarah's evil sidekick, staring right at him. It was like looking into the jaws of a shark (or at least what he assumed it would feel like--not ever having been allowed to leave the town to go somewhere like a beach).

"Me?" Doland asked, his voice breaking slightly.

He realized his mistake too late. Michelle had been looking past him but now her laser guided gaze locked onto him.

"Cohen," she said, sneering. "You graced this little shindig with your royal presence. How," Michelle paused, though Doland knew it was probably for effect. "...quaint."

"Michelle," he said carefully. Cohen Duck (still pronounced 'Duke') III had told him once that saying very little and making every statement potentially also be a question could get him through most uncomfortable situations. Especially board room meetings or speaking engagements in front of the plant workers.

Michelle waited and the two of them stared at each other. Doland was about to make an excuse to leave when the unthinkable happened.

The Duck family had few hard and fast rules but one that had been passed since 1934 was never ever lose your cool in public. It had only happened once in family history, during the 1920's. A young Cohen Doland Duck was drinking in a speakeasy with a few other clandestine patrons when his liquid courage clashed with his good sense. He picked a fight with a random stranger "over a dame". The fight had been uneventful but the family almost came to ruin. The first born Duck of every generation shared one quality: when they became angry they begin to splutter, half swallow their words￼, generally sound like the character known the world over as...

"Donald Duck!" Michelle said. "Oh my gosh, you sound like Donald Duck when he's angry!" She looked shocked like She couldn't believe she had missed it all these years.￼

"I do not!" Doland yelled exactly in a voice like Donald Duck's angry squawk.

Around them people were starting to turn and stare. And then the worst of all things happened, the only thing that could've truly sealed Doland's fate and that of his family: the music stopped.

"You take it back right now, Michelle, you--" Good God, Doland thought , I almost said 'you wascally wabbit'! That's not even the same cartoon show!￼ . Even to his own ears he sounded like a spluttering angry duck. He needed an exit fast.

Michelle was staring at him slightly in awe. "It's like this moment was written for you in time."

Doland smiled uncomfortably.

"My God, have you always done this?" Michelle went on. "No, I would've picked up on it and made your life a living hell. Donald Duck." She turned to the crowd that had begun to gather.

"Duck," she said simply. "Not Duke. He's Donald Duck."

Dolan was moving before he knew what what was happening. His hands reached for Michelle's throat.￼ Then something large slammed into him and he was crashing into the gym floor. He could hear his own squawking increasing. He looked up. That big jock, TJ, was standing over him looking as surprised and shocked as Doland felt.￼ The big boy looked down at his feet confused, as if they weren't his own. Doland saw TJ's hand coming at him and try to dodge to the side at the last minute￼￼. Instead almost comically he's managed to fall into TJ's outstretched hand￼. Doland saw stars for a few seconds then he jumped to his feet, squawked something even he couldn't understand, and dashed for the door.

"TJ punched Donald Duck," someone said as he passed through the crowd. They didn't pronounce it 'Duke￼' either. Doland wondered if the night could get any worse￼.

Michelle turned to the large middle school boy. He was a giant even among high school boys and standing so close to him she expected to feel intimidated. Instead she felt…strangely calm.￼ Until she saw him lick the blood off of his fingers. She wasn't the only one.

"He drank blood!!" Someone yelled.

TJ looked at the hand that was still resting partway into his mouth. "No, it's--"

The rest was lost as middle school kids ran screaming in all directions. Plastic cups of red punch and plates of cake went flying. Coach Neumann, who had been in the process of flirting with the new biology teacher, managed to look up￼￼ right as 10 kids trampled him in a rush to find an exit.￼

"Wait, I--" TJ started, then stumbling back to dodge a stream of racing science geeks, accidentally smashed into the ice sculpture in the punch bowl that had been carved by someone to look like the statue from the center of town.￼ The statue shattered and people screamed.

"TJ bit me!" someone yelled.

"Run!"

"He's going crazy again!"

TJ upended a table trying to get up but slipping on spilled punch. The new biology teacher screamed in terror and loved the first thing to hand at him￼￼￼. Cake plastered across TJ's face and he clawed it away￼.

"He's possessed!" someone said. ￼

TJ half saw, half felt another plate￼ of cake flying at his head from the direction of the new biology teacher. He ducked instinctively. That was unfortunate because Mr. Sanderson, the head of the math department￼, ended up with a face full of vanilla cake. Coach Newman meanwhile grabbed a new plate of cake out of the biology teacher's hand before she lobbed it one at his star player￼ too. Unfortunately, ￼Mr. Sanderson managed to clear his eyes just in time to see Coach Newman holding the plate of cake. Sanderson never cared much for the￼ stuck up athletic director. He was always late to department head meetings￼ and in spite of his Neanderthal looks was just as good as Sanderson in debating minor points of order￼ and clauses in policy documents. The heads committee hadn't made a decision on anything in four years because they were still debating the wording of the 5th paragraph in the second subsection of a policy document designed to determine how the committee would discuss policy documents.￼￼. The argument has gone on so long but no one really even sure what's the debate was about and frequently and seemed both men ended up arguing the other ones point for them.￼

The cowardly cake attack only solidified the math department head's pent up ire.

"Suck it, Newman," he screamed and tossed the fragments of the cake back at his assumed attacker.

The coach having the lighting reflexes￼ of a man who had not seen his toes in 15 years did manage to turn away and dodge the onrushing cake. He failed to account for and had actually forgotten about the cup of punch still in his hand￼. Or at least he had until he watched as the liquid from it splashed into the face of the new biology teacher.

For a moment it looked as if the biology teacher was going the swing on him then she too was hit by flying cake from the hard sciences side of the room. A side that she had originally tried to sit down on but that had scorned her since in their opinion was that biology was more of a "squishy" science like astrology o￼r anthropology or any of the other -polys. ￼She had been relegated to the soft science￼ side with its troglodytes, pond scum, English teachers and non-Spanish speaking Spanish teacher, Mr. Juarez.

But an oppressed people will only take so much. Everyone in the soft side stood as a unit and follow the lead of their de facto new leader, a biology teacher, as she dove over the table and charged the evil hard science cartel.

TJ meanwhile had crawled to an open door that led to the outside. As he left on all fours he heard angry squawking￼￼ off in the distance. He knew he just made another mortal enemy somehow.￼. Tears began to well up in his eyes. He wiped them angrily. He has actually been trying to help the Duke boy up. How did things gone so wrong…Again!￼?!!?

The thought came to him unbidden: Michelle.￼. Michelle was responsible for everything tonight. He would get blamed for starting all the fights. He would get blamed for scaring people.He would get blamed and spend yet more time in in school suspension which was really just additional practice time for the football team.￼ Michelle he thought . It was Michelle. It was always Michelle .
