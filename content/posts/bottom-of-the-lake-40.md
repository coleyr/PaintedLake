Doyle sat down heavily into the high bound leather chair across from Harry.  He took a deep draw off one of the two tumblers of brandy he was holding.  Harry ignored him and stared into the roaring fireplace nearby.

Doyle raised the other glass, his finger pointing at Harry.  He started to speak and then drained the tumbler, set it aside and pointed at Harry again.  He started to speak again, stopped, and drained the second tumbler.

"Are you 'rightfully, and royally drunk' enough yet?" Harry asked, still looking at the fire.

"I will God damn well tell you when God damn I am drunk enough," Doyle roared.  A few of the other members of the Club looked over, but not many.  Even the staff made no move to encourage proper decorum as they might with another gentleman.  Doyle shook his finger at Harry but seemed to be at a loss for words.

Harry ignored him and watched the flames.  On a small table between the two chairs was a folded newspaper inside of which was wrapped the German insignia.  At Madame Evrelsa's (or Velsa's as Harry was coming to think of her) no one--including Velsa--had wanted to touch it so the valets had used a newspaper to scoop it up.  Doyle had protested that even until Harry had pointed out that the valets' had used was the Sports page.  At the point, Doyle had grudgingly let Harry accept the wrapped up newspaper and stormed out into the alley.

Doyle reached over and grabbed Harry's untouched drink.  He downed it in a single swallow then slammed the tumbler down.  He glared at Harry, looking for some sort of response.

"Now?" Harry asked.

Enraged, Doyle cast his eyes about angrily for another tumbler.  Not finding one he picked up Harry's and slammed it down again.

"You are behaving like a child," Harry said finally turning to look at Doyle.

"You are God damned right!  I am scared off of my marbles," Doyle whispered fiercely.

"And I am not," replied Harry.  He turned back to the fire.  "The bttom of the lake.  What do you think it means, Doyle?"

Doyle shoved himself back into his chair.  He started to reach for the newspaper then froze, remembering what it held.   He quickly pulled his hand back.  After a moment, he patted angrily at his jacket pocket searching for a cigar.  Finally, he gave up and waved over one of the Club's staff, a tall, elderly man, for one and a set of matches.

"You are sure it is genuine?" Harry asked once the elderly man was gone.  Doyle looked down at the newspaper and then away quickly.

"Yes," he muttered.  "But they are easy to find.  We killed a hundred thousand of those bastards on the Western front."

"Bastards?" Harry raised an eyebrow.  "You believe it is his?  Your...adversary."

Doyle peeled back the newspaper slightly, looked inside then let it fall closed.  He shrugged and re-lit his cigar with fresh match.

"I hate the brand of these they keep here at this Club," he said loudly to no one in particular.  "Won't stay properly lit."

Harry reached down and picked up the insignia carefully.  He leaned over and held it in Doyle's face.  "Is it his?" he said, the words drawn out.

"Perhaps," Doyle said in the same evenly measured tone.  "It appeared, appeared, mind you, to come from the wall.  You of all people know it could be slight of hand."

"Yes.  But the scene that played out on the wall?" Harry asked.  "That was you, was it not?"

Doyle leaned back deeper into the chair.  "It was a moving picture.  Of two men dressed in uniforms and one died.  Appeared to die."  Doyle suddenly shot forward.  "These women are charlatans.  I have told that story a hundred times in bars on both sides of the Atlantic."

Harry raised an eyebrow.  "I have never heard you speak of it.  Why do I doubt anyone has heard it before?"

"Bess has," Doyle said coldly.  "Ask your wife the next time you see her."

Now it was Harry who bristled.  He slammed the insignia onto the small table and turned back toward the fire, his eyes hard.  Doyle regarded him angrily then deflated and sighed.  He signaled for another drink.

"I am sorry, Harry," he said, "that was petulant."

Doyle picked up the insignia and examined it closely.  "When I stayed with you during that bout of fever I must have raved it at some point, because late one evening she cornered me in the kitchen and demanded the story."  Doyle looked up from the insignia.

"Where was I?" Harry asked distantly.

"Asleep, I suppose.  She set a right proper ambush, too.  Came with a bottle of cognac and two glasses.  At first, I thought all of my dreams had come true and she had come to her senses."

Harry chuckled.  "You hold a special place in her heart."

"Damn all beautiful women who fall madly in love with a man's best friend," Doyle grumbled, but he was smiling.

"You should have--" Harry started.

"Skipped the horse races," Doyle finished with mock sourness.  It was an old joke.  After a moment, he crushed his cigar in the tray and sat forward.  He took Harry's hand gently.

"If you go down this path, Harry, you will lose her.  Leave this.  Go find her.  Start your life with Bess again.  Women are amazing creatures, they can forgive a man almost anything.  And then make him pay for the rest of his life."

Harry smiled then said seriously.  "I should.  I know it," he grabbed Doyle's hand and flipped it over with a flourish.  The German insignia was in it.  "But something came across, Doyle.  Maybe..."

"Maybe something can go back across," Doyle said, balling his hand into a fist, the insignia cutting painfully into his palm.  His mask was on but inside he was filled with silent, impotent rage.  He wanted to toss the insignia into the fire.  He wanted to someone to fight.  He wanted a corporeal opponent that he could swing against, to drive his fists into until his knuckles were bloody.  At the moment, Doyle would have given anything to be able to fight whatever was breaking the two people he loved most in this world.

But he was helpless.

Doyle forced himself to relax his fist.  Harry was nattering on, uncharacteristically obtuse to the struggle going on inside Doyle.

"We have to return to Madame Evrelsa," Harry was saying.  He rocked back and forth in his chair.  "Make her tell us more.  About, about everything."

Doyle ignored Harry's incessant monologue and closed his fist around the insignia again, though more gently this time.  He mimed punching his own chin.  "Bastard..." he whispered.
