"Doyle." Harry said softly.  Doyle angled his head slightly toward Harry but did not look at him.

"Doyle," Harry repeated, walking towards him.

Madame Zoska put a hand on Harry's arm to hold him back.  "Quickly," she hissed.  She pointed towards one of the seats around the table then took her own.  "Quickly," she said.  "He is close."

Harry took his seat.  "Who is close?"

"The German," Zoska said.

"In the entire 'spirit world'," Harry made a disgusted face, " there is a single German?  What happened to the rest?  There is a single--"

"For him, yes," Zoska said.  She removed a deck of cards from her inner coat pocket.  She quickly shuffled them and spread them across the table.  Harry started to rise but she grabbed his arm.  She was surprisingly strong.  "It is not for you."

"Your German friend, yes?" Madame Zoska said to Doyle who continued to stare off into the distance.

"Can you hear him?" Doyle asked absently.  He looked back at Harry and Zoska.  "Can you?"

They looked at each other and then shook their heads slowly.

"For a moment," Harry said.  "Possibly.  I heard something."

Zoska dealt a card and showed it to Harry.

"The King of Spades," he said.  Zoska nodded.  She drew another card but held it face down.

"You hear someone speaking to you?" he asked Doyle.

Zoska showed the card to Harry.  Harry picked up the first card and looked at it.  "They are both the king of spades?"  Zoska shrugged and drew another card.

"Harry," Doyle said, "he wants to know what you want."

"What I want?" Harry asked.  "From the...ghost?"  Zoska started to draw another card, but Harry put a hand up to stop her.

"He says you called him, Harry.  He wants to go back.  And..." Doyle listened.  "And he is angry at being forced back to the..."  Doyle cursed colorfully.  "My German is horrible."

"The man or the language?" Harry asked.

Doyle scowled at him.  "The language," he growled.  His eyes lost focus.  "The pain.  He is back to the pain."

"What does that mean?" Harry asked Zoska.

"How the bloody Hell should I know?" Doyle roared think Harry was asking him.

"What is 'the pain'?" asked Harry.  "You are sure you hear someone?"

"I hear two someones chattering in my ear," Doyle said.  "Stop drawing those damn cards," he snapped at Zoska.  She hesitated then set the deck down.  "He says...time is pain."

"What?" Harry asked.

"I told you I don't bloody well know, Harry," Doyle yelled.  "It is 'Time is pain' or pain is time'.  Stupid asinine German sentence structure.  No wonder they lost the bloody war.  Cannot even complete an understandable sentence."  Doyle cursed again.

Zoska pushed the deck of cards towards Harry and gestured for him to deal one.  Harry violently shook his head.  Zoska threw up her hands, stood up and walked over to the tea service sitting by the doorway.

"I do not have any goddamned beer," Doyle said.  "Harry, ask him.  He is blowing out my ears with his yelling."

"That is a feat," Harry muttered.  "Ask him where my daughter is."

Doyle listened for a moment.  "He says 'she is too high'."

"Doyle, if this is some sort of joke--"

Doyle slammed his fist into the plaster wall.  It cracked slightly.

"Sorry," Harry said.  "It is just that sometimes you want so hard to believe that I--"

"Too high," Doyle repeated.  "Something about purity and war and dirt.  No, war and being dirty.  God, that is right if anything ever was."

The two men looked at Zoska who only stared back coolly.

"I think she may be in Heaven, Harry.  Too far from him."

"Ask him what the Devil looks like," Harry said.

"He says the Devil looks like a short, rude magician who drags his friends into terribly odd situations."

Harry was silent for a moment.  "Did he really say that?"

"Of course not!" Doyle yelled.

"Your souls--the German, the Soldier and the Liar--are too corrupted to get to her," Zoska said.

"Ask her if he can bring her back," Harry said suddenly.

Doyle frowned.  "He says bring him 'the good' and he will find 'the girl'.  I may be translating that wrong."

"He wants--what does he want?" Harry asked.

"The cards," Zoska said.  Harry looked down and expertly spread them in his nimble fingers.  The were all the king of spades.

"We are all soiled in our souls, Unbeliever," Zoska said.  "Your friend's German wants to rise to Heaven and will find your daughter there."

"What does he want me to do?" Harry asked.

"Good," said Doyle and Zoska at the same time.

"He wants you to purify your soul and give him those clean parts," Doyle added.  "Or so it sounds to me."

"How am I supposed to do that?" Harry asked.  "How do you clean your own soul?"
