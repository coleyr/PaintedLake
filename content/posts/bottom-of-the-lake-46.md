Bess stared longingly at the door.  Her dinner companion was into his fourth Hotty Toddy and proving the old adage that there could be too much of a good thing.  She had managed to count the number of candles on the chandelier, its hanging tassels and the sequins on the dress of the woman behind her dinner companion.

Bess had heard of people who could not stop counting, mostly in her days traveling with Harry.  One man even rattled off numbers at random for years until they realized allegedly that he was counting everything around him.  Bess could understand the draw of using the mundane to combat the brutally boring.

"371," she said suddenly, finishing the sequin count.

The man across from her stopped mid sentence.  "Come again?"

Bess blushed.  "371.  It is a type of..." She scanned around the room, her eyes coming to rest on the glass tumbler in front of her companion.  "...a type of whiskey where I am from."

"Oh, where is that?" the man asked.

"Enough about me," Bess said.  "What were you saying again, ah...?" Felix....maybe?  Fenton? "Of course, yes, some people--and I will not name names--but I could..." her dinner partner, definitely Fenton, leaned in conspiratorially, "for the promise of an after dinner stroll."

"You are too kind, but it is getting late," Bess said.

"Yes," her companion smiled lewdly.  "It is, in fact, getting late."

The chair to her right pulled out suddenly and a man sat down.  Bess and her companion looked over shocked.  It was Doyle.

"Bess," he said.  "We need to speak."

"Excuse me!" Bess's companion said.  "What are you doing?"

Doyle ignored him.  "Harry is slipping."

"Who is," her companion said the name like it was a disgusting dish, "Harry?"

Doyle looked over annoyed.

"My husband," Bess said.  "Soon-to-be ex-husband."

If the fact that Bess had a husband surprised her dinner companion he did not show it.  He ignored her and focused on Doyle.  "You are interrupting our dinner--"

"Do you know who I am?" Doyle asked.

"No, do you know who--"

Doyle punched Bess's dinner companion squarely in the jaw.  He reeled back momentarily and then he fell forward, his face crashing heavily into the table.  Doyle picked up the man's head slightly to make sure he had not fallen on a fork or cracked the plate.  Satisfied, he dropped the man's head back onto the table and turned back to Bess.

"That technically is my date you punched out, Doyle," Bess said, looking around the room.  She tried to smile at the other patrons: Boys will be boys. But no one seemed to share her sentiment.  She could see the restaurant staff silently arguing about who would approach her and Doyle.  Somehow the casualness of Doyle' violence was more intimidating than if he had come in screaming in rage.

"Farrington Wenworth?" Doyle said.  "When did you start dating again?  I thought you were, ah, waiting for Harry to come around." Farrington! she thought.  Then she was suddenly angry.  "I am not one of your tender high society wall flowers, Arthur."

He grinned.  "I know."

She felt the old rage buried under ignored sorrow.  "You like to see me angry," she said.

His grinned widened.  "It's too bad I went to the horse races."

She laughed at their old joke in spite of her anger.  She looked around the room.  Some people were pointedly ignoring her and Doyle and whispering fiercely while others were still staring.  She silently cursed her lack of social knowledge.  How should she exit this situation?  Where she grew up a punch would have kicked off a full scale bar room brawl.

"We should go," she said.

The manager--Bess assumed it was the manager by the rich cut of his suit--approached the table somewhat cautiously.

"Sir," he said to Doyle.  Doyle grabbed Farrington's napkin and placed it on his own lap.

"A bottle of whatever the lady was drinking and a plate of whatever the gentleman was having, if you please.  It smells delicious."

The manager spluttered. "Sir, you and your companion--"

Doyle raised a finger.  "I am richer and definitely more famous than Farrington Wentworth.  Plus," he leaned over and spoke softly, "this establishment will be the talk of the town for weeks."

The manager stared at Doyle then turned to a few of the wait staff who had been hanging back.  He nodded at the them.  "Of course, sir," he smiled ingratiatingly.  "Would the gentleman care for a brandy as well?"

"Splendid suggestion, my good man!  Make it two?" Doyle nodded to Bess.  She sighed and nodded.  The manager gave her a slightly disapproving look then looked fearfully at Doyle and scuttled off towards the restaurant bar.

"It's about Harry," Doyle said again.

"Isn't it always," Bess said.  She settled back in her chair for what, as always, promised to be a good story.
