Michael peeled himself from his bed and with blurry vision began to rifle through his sock drawer. His hand clumsily pushing to the bottom of the drawer in search of a clean pair. The crinkling sound of paper may have failed to register in the early fog morning if Michael had not jammed so many under shirts and socks into a pile such the drawer wouldn't close. Upon resorting the stack of clothes some envelopes could be seen. The first was labeled E1. Michael unfolded it, sat on his bed and read it.

Hey Michael,

I know you are probably having a blast at summer camp! The pictures make it look like fun. I saw the image of you holding up that scorpion, I can't believe that was in your sleeping bag! I would loved to see that up close, admittedly not in my sleeping bag. I saw your tan, ow ow. But seriously you should wear sunscreen, as a chronically paper white person I have an appropriate fear of the sun. They are your burns but be careful, ya know?

I am having a good time with my internship/job. I really like Mrs. Jacobs, she is a fan of big band music, kinda fun listening to it while filling orders and mixing paint. They are better songs to shake cans to but I make due with the old timey stuff. One day when I was filling cans I almost blacked out! The fumes must have really gotten to my head, I tumbled a bit and my eyes had tunnels at the end, but I blinked a few times and it went away! Weird huh?

It made me think about a time when we were younger, you and me we making a snack at my house, mac and cheese. I remember you spaced out for like a whole minute then you were all like 'wow my hands are so small!?' You remember? Ha, I laughed at that for a while when I remembered it. One of the songs made me think of that memory, the melody sorta washed it up on the shore for me to see. I remember after that I made you mac and cheese but that cant be right... My mom wouldn't let me use the stove, I was like six. But I do remember distinctly having mac and cheese. Maybe I broke the rules and didn't bother too remember, typical.

I hope you get to eat ... tbc
