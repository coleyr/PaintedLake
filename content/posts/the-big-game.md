T.J. sprinted down the hall of Wing C. He had not been here since Sarah disappeared. He slid to a stop in front of the door to the stairs leading to the boiler room.

The door was slightly ajar and T.J. peered into the crack, trying to see what might lay behind it. He could see light flickering but that was all.

Carefully, he edged the door open. Stairs led down to a shadowy corridor that turned right and--he knew from memory--led to the ancient boilers and a cot some student had stashed behind one of the boilers ages ago.

T.J. crept carefully down the stairs and chanced a look around the corner. The giant boilers that kept the school warm in the winter sat silent like sentries along the walls. In the center of the room, a medium-sized fire burned in a makeshift fire can and six cloaked and hooded figures walked slowly around it, chanting softly.

TJ edged carefully along the wall and tried not to let his movements draw the chanting figures' attention. He made it to the first boiler and slipped behind it. He saw Michelle and the other two crouching behind the third boiler. They waved him forward silently.

When he had crawled close enough, Michelle whispered to him. "You stopped to change clothes?"

TJ looked down at his football uniform self-consciously. "The game is tonight," he whispered, slightly defensive.

Michelle rolled her eyes.

"They have been circling for about 30 minutes now," Daniel whispered. He and Rodney were taking turns keeping an eye on the cloaked figures.

"No human sacrifices or anything?" TJ asked quietly.

Daniel shook his head. "No, we were here before them and we didn't see them bring anyone else in."

"Did you check the cot?" TJ asked trying to look through the opening between the 2nd and 3rd boilers.

"What cot?" Daniel said.

"It wasn't pulled out," Michelle whispered.

"Wait, what cot?" Daniel asked.

"The one behind the fifth boiler on the other side of the room," Rodney whispered without looking up. He had just crawled back to join the group.

"You know about the boiler boinging bed?" Daniel asked. His whispered was starting to become a little loud. Rodney nodded, his focus fixed on the chanting figures.

"Great, so we know which one of us we can offer up as a virgin sacrifice if they catch us," Michelle whispered. "Anything else, you--"

"Did you bring Sarah here?" Daniel hissed T.J. who suddenly found the back of a distant boiler really interesting.

"Yes, just once," Michelle said. "But it was a mistake. A beautiful mistake."

The three guys stared at her, their mouths agape. Daniel looked shocked, Rodney blushed and T.J. gave her an involuntary once over.

Michelle smiled wickedly. "Men are so easy. I'm joking."

The three boys laughed a little self consciously.

"Or am I?" Michelle said. This time all three blushed and looked away.

After a minute Rodney put a cautioning hand up. "Crazy cultist, remember? Mess with our hormones later."

As if on cue, a woman's voice said from the other side of the boilers: Are we ready yet or what?". The four froze.

"Yes," said a man's voice though he sounded like he would rather be shoving an ice pick through the woman's skull.

Rodney and TJ peered around one side of the boiler and Michelle and Daniel took point on the other side.

One of the hooded figures brought a book and a wicked looking knife from beneath his cloak.

"Let us begin," he said.
