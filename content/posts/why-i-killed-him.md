Doyle grunted as he pulled his bag over the steam pipe barring his way.  It was an evil pipe and its brethren had banged his shins and tripped him up more times that he could count.

"A'right, sir?" Dobbs asked.  Doyle gave him a venomous stare at which Dobbs gave him a wink and trudged on ahead.  Doyle, pipe cleared, reshouldered his burlap sack with as much of dignity as he could muster.

Dobbs was easily carrying two large sacks, twice the size of Doyle's.  He had one slung over each shoulder but would transfer them both to a single hand periodically to offer a hand to Doyle or Harry when the were trying to scale a particularly dangerous pipe or cross a flimsy plank.  In that moment, Doyle hated Dobbs as he had hated no other man in his...well, that night.  Harry was coming a close second on Doyle's hate list though.  His bag was definitely smaller than Doyle's and he also had that stupid manic grin back.

"Do you feel like the walls are closing in?" Harry asked cheerfully.

Doyle looked around.  "Not until you just said it, Harry," he said in even measured tones.  "Thank you for your leadership," he added with as much spite as his manage in his current exhausted state.

"Not me, sir," Dobbs called from a few yards up.  He had stopped to light a cigarette.

"Don't let those sacks touch the ground!" Doyle called, but Dobbs only smiled and raised the two sacks in one hand to show he still had them off the ground.

"I hate him," Doyle muttered.

Harry smiled warmly.  "He is very fond of you, Arthur.  We both are."

"That is because I am quite bloody fetching," Doyle grumbled.  "At least I am when I am not traipsing through underground tunnels with two idiots due to one idiot's bloody idiotic idiot idea.  Then I am a real bloody bastard to be around!"

Harry badly attempted to cover a smirk.  "Are not all tunnels 'underground' by their very nature?"

"Can I ask ya a question, Mr. Doyle?' Dobbs said.  Harry and Doyle had caught up to him.  Dobbs took the lead again and talked back over his shoulder as he navigated the tunnels.

Doyle tried to think of a sufficiently biting response, but could come up with nothing.  "No," he said after a minute.

The three moved in grunting, cursing silence for a few moments. Sewer grates allowed light in at various junctions. It created the illusion that they walked from pool to pool, their footsteps echoing down the tunnel.

Eventually, Dobbs looked back at Doyle then to Harry. Doyle and Harry exchanged a glance. Harry nodded.

"I could use a brief respite," Harry said.

"No," Doyle grumbled and shifted his shoulders.

Dobbs held out his hand to Harry. "Do yah--"

"No, that bloody idiot can carry his own sack," Doyle said and lumbered forward.  Every muscle in his back and arms hurt but he would be damned if that damn ox brain was going to coddle him or Harry.

Dobbs let Harry pass then fell in step behind him. He started to hum slightly.

He made it four bars into the song before Doyle growled, "What's your bloody question, Dobbs?"

Dobbs smiled slightly to himself. Then his face took on a thoughtful expression. "Why did ya kill 'em, Mr. Doyle?"

Harry and Doyle exchanged a look while they tried somewhat unsuccessfully to make it past a series of shin-attacking pipes.

"You obviously are still alive--at least from the neck down and Harry am not planning to kill until we get out of this bloody tunnel. So...why did I kill whom?" Doyle asked as the three worked their way through the maze of pipes.

"Sharlock Homes.  The detective," Dobbs said.

"Holmes, you mean? From the book?" Harry asked, shocked. "With words...?"

Dobbs nodded.  "Yah, 'im."

Harry said, "I apologize, Dobbs, but, well, it is rather shocking that a man of your, uh, talents--"

"Of course, I read," Dobbs said, offended.  "See!" He reached in his coat with his free hand and pulled a worn paperback out of his coat pocket.

Harry took the paperback and turned it over where he could see it by the light filtering in from the street above them.

"Is that a penny dreadful?" Doyle asked, gritting his teeth.

Dobbs took the book back from Harry and waved it in Doyle's face.  "No. It's Sharlock Homes.  It's yur book, Mr. Doyle," he said very slowly.  Dobbs looked at it again as if making sure it was the correct book then shoved it back under Doyle's nose.

Doyle ignored the book, shouldered his bag and angrily stomped forward.  "It is not MY book, Dobbs.  This is a distilled counterfeit with pictures.  It is a book for children.  Thieving children, come to think of it."  He whirled on Dobbs as fast as a man struggling under such a great weight could.  "Did you even pay for that or did you lift it from a book stand?"

Dobbs scrunched up his broad face in thought.  "Bought," he said after a moment then gave Doyle and Harry a weak smile.  "Ay thank Ay bought it."

"Then you owe me a penny," Doyle roared.  "I am taking it out of this week's wage."

"Doyle," Harry said, at the crestfallen look on Dobbs' face.  "He is reading your story--"

Doyle started to turn and start walking but after a moment's thought dropped his sack on the ground.  "It is bloody thievery, Harry.  How would you feel if someone stole your tricks and performed shoddy versions of them?"

Harry shifted his sack while he considered the point.  He nodded at Doyle.  "Dobbs, you have done a very bad thing.  Those Sherlock Holmes (with an 'L' by the way, Dobbs), those Sherlock Holmes stories took a lot of work of Doyle's part.  It is a bit like robbing him."

Dobbs looked hurt.  "I--"

"I, I, I," Doyle spat.  He pointed at the bag at his feet.  "You can start your apology by carrying my bag as well, you dumb, thieving lumox!"

Dobbs easily picked up the third bag and tossed it over his shoulder.  "Sorry," he said.

Doyle pushed past him.  "This tunnel goes on forever.  It is like we are stuck in Hell.  I am stuck in Hell with two idiots."

They walked in silence for a few minutes while Harry periodically checked a crudely drawn map.

"Dobbs," Harry said, walking a pace behind Dobbs.  "You said Holmes died?"

"Yah, went right over a cliff 'e did," Dobbs replied.

"Really?" Harry asked, curious.  "In that version in your pocket?"

Suddenly ahead of them Doyle, who had been focusing on not banging his shins, stopped and turned around.  "What did you just ask, Harry?"

"I asked--"

Doyle exploded.  "You have not read the entire series?!!?  Good God, man!  Even this dumb ox has read SOME version of the entire story.  That is some of my best work!"

"I am sorry, Doyle, but they were beginning to get repetitive," Harry said.  Dobbs held out his hand for Harry's bag.  Harry handed it over to Dobbs, who added it to the other three on his shoulder.  "Thank you, Doyle."

Dobbs nodded then started walking.  "Mr. 'arry is not wrong, say," he said.

"You read bloody pictures, you inebriated monkey humping ape," Doyle said.  "Harry, are--"

"So he IS dead?  Your main character?" Harry asked.

"Went right over a cliff, 'e did," Dobbs said.

"Really?" Harry asked.

"Wait!" Doyle said, "You--bloody Hell!" Doyle had failed to notice Dobbs slight bow to avoid a low hung pipe and hit his head on it.  "Bloody! Hell!"

"What do you mean you have not read the last book?" Doyle asked, rubbing the spot where he had hit the pipe.

"I bought them, I just have not had time to read them," Harry said.  He pointed at another low hanging pipe.  Dobbs caught that one on the head and let out a string of curses.

"I do not bloody well care if you bought the damn book, I want people to read the bloody books." Doyle said.

"Does that mean I still owe you the penny, Mr. Doyle," Dobbs asked.

"Quiet!" Doyle yelled.  "And, yes, you do."  He turned back to Harry.  "Why have you not completed the series?"

"I told you.  It just seemed to be getting repetitive," Harry said.  "One case after another--"

"He's a detective, you dolt!" Doyle fumed. He stormed ahead a few yards then he slowed for them to catch up.  "I killed him because it was the character's story arc.  That is what had to happen."

"This is it," Dobbs said, looking up.  He pointed at a rickety ladder leading up to what appeared to be a trapdoor in the dim light.  He stopped and put a hand on it and shifted the bags so that he could climb up one-handed.  Harry and Doyle stopped at the base of the ladder and looked up.

Dobbs paused, his foot on the first step.  "So you killed Sharlock--"

"Sherlock," Doyle corrected angrily.

"Shurelock," Dobbs said.  "So you killed Shurelock because he wanted to die?"

"Yes, it was his character arc. Let's go," Doyle said, running a hand over his face. 

"You were making a lot of money on those books, Doyle," Harry said.

"And they were good, they were," Doyle added helpfully.

Doyle pointed up the ladder. When Harry and Dobbs did not move he sighed.  "Fine.  I killed him because I was sick of him.  Sick to death of him."

"That seems harsh, Mr. Doyle," Dobbs said, softly. "You made 'em. Like he was a son."

Doyle looked back and forth between Dobbs and Harry.  "He is a bloody character.  He is not real.  Who cares if I make him fall over a waterfall?"

Dobbs shrugged.  "Sure," he said and started to climb. "But if Sharlock was me boy, I'd do him a better turn."

"Wait," Doyle said testily.  "He is not dead."  Dobbs raised his eyebrows and paused mid-step.  "The publishers," Doyle said with a sigh.  "They have been pressuring me for years to bring Holmes back.  But dead is dead.  When you are dead you do not come back." Harry looked down at his feet and Dobbs looked away uncomfortably.  Doyle sighed a second time.  "It was during the typhoid outbreak.  One of them.  My wife was...recently sick.  We were all trapped inside our homes.  It was terrible.  Every day I would look out and see children sitting in their windows staring out at the world.  They were not out in the street playing.  People were not out walking or working.  We all just sat inside our homes staring at each other or across the way at our neighbors.  No one had any answers or knew how long it would be like that.  It was like the entire world was on the side lines of a boxing match we were all supposed to be fighting in.  I wanted--I wanted--I wanted at least one person to get the life, or the, well, death, that he deserved.  A death that he would want.  Of his own choosing.  To live his life to the last of it the way HE wanted.  Not sitting inside waiting to see what would happen." The three were silent for a minute then Dobbs shifted the bags and started up the ladder.  "'I'ull read 'em proper, Mr Doyle.  No pictures.  At least the last one where he dies.  Mr. Harry will, too. Right, Mr. Harry?"

"Ah...yes, of course,"  Harry said.  "Especially if Holmes is coming back," he added.  "Everyone loves a happy ending."

Doyle nodded.  "Don't they just, though."  He looked up at the trapdoor Dobbs was making his way towards.  "Don't they just."
