"Doyle, do you ever do things just because they are the right thing to do?"

Harry stamped his feet, trying to warm up his bod.  He was convinced that his blood had frozen over hours ago.  Inside his jacket pockets, Harry's hands and fingers nervously danced moves to pick locks.

"What?" Doyle hissed.  Somewhere he had acquired a bowler hat and now had it pulled tightly over his ears.  It looked slightly silly but the two were freezing and even Doyle's eternal temper had dulled slightly.  Though only slightly.

"What the devil kind of question is that, Harry?"

"Is that a no?"  Harry mentally switched locks; now a padlock for his left, safe combination for his right.  Once he had practiced each of the major names locks; one in each hand.  Then he learned to work one in each hand at the same time.  A decade ago he had quit carrying most locks since he knew them better than most of their manufacturers.  Eventually he did not carry any but still his hands danced their complicated dance at the edge of his periphery.

Doyle grunted and peer around the corner again.

"Our Mr. Doyle here does the right thing all the time, Mr. Harry," Dobbs said.  He was wrapped in a thick jacket and sported a giant fur cap.  Harry suspected it had come from the gypsy's house, though, not during any visit he or Doyle had been at.

"Do tell, Dobbs, do tell," Harry said.  Doyle moved and Harry took his place at the corner peering around.

"Stop that!" Doyle barked.

"Me?" Dobbs asked. "I was--"

"No, Dobbs, I am speaking to my curious cat here," Doyle said, rubbing his hands together.  "It will come Harry, come away from the wind."

Harry stepped back deeper into the alley.  He pulled his hands out of his pockets and stretched them out.

"Why dah you do that, 'r. Harry?  That thing with your hands?"

Harry looked down at his hands, the fingers twitching patterns.  "I prefer not to die."

"He practices picking locks," Doyle said.  "Like that cousin of yours only Harry gets paid to break into and out of places."

Dobbs considered for a moment.  "Oh, 'e gets paid, too, me cousin.  Or did."  He dragged a finger across his throat.

"Dead?" Harry asked.  Doyle peered around the corner then motioned for them to follow him.

"Oh no, 'r. Harry.  Married, not dead," Dobbs let out a giant laugh at his own joke.  "Had ta sell his kit and get a real job."

Doyle shot Dobbs a sour look.  "He works that damn joke into every conversation, Harry.  I think he is trying to kill  me with stupidity."

Dobbs and Harry followed Doyle around the corner and out into the roaring wind.  It was bad in town, whipping around the buildings, knocking down the unwary or unsober.  But here on the water it was nearly impossible to stand against its frequent blasts.  Doyle made his way carefully down a rickety dock towards a shadow moving silently along it.

Two men jumped out of the small craft and Harry felt Dobbs' pace increase until he was immediately behind Doyle.  The men had carried lines with them and now were tying down the boat to the dock's cleats.

"How long are you planning on staying here?" Doyle asked one of the men as they approached.  The man's features were hard to make out in the gloom.

"Not long now," the man had a slight whistle when he spoke.  The other man finished tying out and scrambled back onto the boat.

"Stay close," Dobbs muttered to Harry.  He eyed the boat and the sailor in front of them warily.

"Make it quick," Doyle said.  "It's cold."

"Where's your lorry?" asked the sailor.

Doyle backhanded him.  The man's head rocked backwards.  Harry felt Dobbs tense beside him and put a hand to Harry's shoulder.

"Problem?" Dobbs growled to Doyle.  The sailor held up a hand as he rubbed his jaw with the other.

"No problems," said the sailor.  He looked up and up some more until he could meet Dobbs' eyes.  He spit something into the water.  "Needed it pulled anyway.  Rotten."

Doyle turned his back on the sailor and stepped towards the gangplank the other sailor was dropping onto the pier.  The sailor on the dock cleared his throat.  "A tooth's a tooth, Fancy, but a man's ship is his woman.  Even his mates have to earn their way on it."

He smiled and Harry could see the thin trickle of blood coming from his mouth and dripping down his chin.

Doyle stepped back and smiled warmly.  "Then let us leave it at the tooth."

After that the three stood back while the sailors unloaded the crates.  Six in all.  Once they had finished, the sailor produced a chit and a worn marking pencil.  He handed it to Doyle.  "Your mark," he said.

Doyle took the paper, scribbled something, then handed it back.  "Bon Voyage," Doyle said and grinned widely.

The sailor stared at him for a moment then shoved the paper in his pocket and went to work freeing the line from the cleats.  The three stood, waiting until the ship cast off.

"So have you?" Harry said.

After a moment of silence, Doyle looked over.  "Have I what?"

"Done something solely because it was the right thing to do?" Harry said.

"No," Doyle said quickly.  He checked his pocket watch then looked out over the water.  "No.  Sometimes I think so, but there always turns out to be a self benefiting motive hidden under the action."

Doyle put his hands against one of the crates.  He looked up and realized Harry and Dobbs were staring at him.  "Well, it is the truth."

"I see that," Harry said.  He stretched his hands again then placed them besides Doyle's on the box.  "It is more honesty than I expected."

"What?!" Doyle bellowed.  He shoved the box and it went flying into the frigid water beside the pier.  The three men stepped forward and peered over the pier watching it.

"All the way down and gone," said Dobbs.  Doyle grunted agreement.  He stepped over the another crate and put his hands on it.  "Can you think of one time you did something, Harry, that was not motivated by self interest?"

Doyle pointed to a nearby crate and Harry went over and put his hands on it.  They pushed at the same time and the two crates went toppling into the water and sank out of site, though Harry had stumbled once or twice on the slick dock as he pushed.

Doyle looked over the side and nodded.

"Deep here, isn't it?" Harry said.  He stamped his feet again.  Out here over the water it was somehow even colder than the shoreline.

To their left, Dobbs rammed a crate with his shoulder until it slid to the edge of the pier and tottered over.  It hit the water with a loud splash and a slight splintering of wood.

"Too close," Doyle scolded.

"Ts heavy one there, 'r Doyle," Dobbs grumbled, massaging his beefy shoulder.  He walked over to another crate and tested it with his hands.  "Dis too!"

"I am aware, Dobbs.  I watched them unload so I could see which was the heaviest and leave those for you and Harry."   Doyle tapped his finger to his nose.  "See?  Self aggrandizing motives."

Harry frowned.  He opened his mouth to respond.  Doyle waved him towards another box.  "Less talk, more pushing," he said.

The three men pushed at the remaining three boxes, trying to angle them so that they went off the dock towards the deeper water.

"Never once.  Even for me?" Harry asked as he strained.  Doyle was pushing with a single hand, easily sliding his box forward.

"Especially not for you," Doyle said.  "I am not sure why you keep showing up at my flat every morning."

"We...go...over...to...his...house," Dobbs grunted through gritted teeth.  He pushed and shoved his box with his shoulder.

"True," Harry said, also straining.  Doyle's box went over the edge first.  He looked between the struggling Harry and Dobbs then stepped back and sat on one of the cleats.  He pulled out a cigar and lit it while he waited.

"With haste, gentlemen," he said.  Harry and Dobbs continued to shove, curse and push their boxes until both had gone over the side and splashed into the water.  Doyle gave them both a moment to catch their breath then stood.

"Let us make haste, boys," he said, "There is a strong drink with my name on it waiting for me at the Club."

Dobbs straightened and helped Harry to his feet.

As the three men walked off the pier Harry shot a quick look back towards the water.  "The men Dobbs' friends are entertaining at the bar currently?"

Doyle puffed as they walked only slowly to a more leisurely place once he had made it to the safety of the alley.  "Dead by tomorrow, by the end of the week at the latest."

Harry turned slightly pale.  "Are you quite serious?"

Doyle chuckled.  "No," Doyle said.  "Most likely the men will spend a cold night in the alley waiting for a ship that has already said onto new nefarious duties.  Ships are lost at sea all the time.  They will report that back and no one will be any the wiser."

Harry was not convinced.  "So their boss won't kill them?  For losing all of that contraband cargo?"

"O' course not, 'r Harry," Dobbs laughed.  "It was probably women's stocking in those boxes.  Nothing too bad.  Just wantin' to skip the tug tax."

"Mine must have had stockings made out of rocks," Harry said, wincing with the memory.  "Big ones."

They exited the alley.  Dobbs headed over to the car and opened the door for Harry and Doyle.  Harry climbed in and Dobbs closed the door.  He walked around to the other side of the car.

"What da' ya t'ink was really in those there boxes, 'r Doyle," Dobbs asked quietly as he opened the door.

Doyle shrugged.  "Contraband.  Guns?  Who knows.  Something bad that will never be used now for its intended design."

Dobbs shrugged as well.  "Long as, 'r Harry is 'appy, I suppose."  He looked at Doyle.  "Them men are dead men though.  You know that."

From inside the car, Harry yelled out.  "What are you too talking over?  It is too cold for that even in here."

Doyle winked as Harry then his face dropped into a neutral expression.  "I know," he said as he climbed into the car's rear seats.

"Home, Dobbs," Doyle said as Dobbs climbed into the front seat, behind the steering wheel.

"Not going to the Club after all?" Harry asked.

Doyle shook his head and stared out the window at the snowy road.  "No.  I think I have had enough fun and good deeds for one night," he said quietly.
