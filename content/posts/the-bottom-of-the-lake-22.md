Arthur led the way through an opening along the back wall with beads hanging across it.  Harry peered closely at the beads as the two men passed through them.

"Is that--Arthur, are those teeth?"

Doyle grabbed one of the off-white colored strings of beads.  "If so that is disgusting."  Doyle quickly dropped the string and reached for his silk handkerchief.

Harry peered closer and then straightened.

"Well?" Doyle asked hesitantly.  Harry nodded.  Doyle tossed his handkerchief onto the floor and continued on down the long hallway.

"You saw quite a few teeth in the ring in your day, I understand," Harry said, grabbing the handkerchief.  He pulled at one of the teeth until it came off and wrapped it carefully in the silk.

"I knocked most of them out," Doyle called back.  "So I knew where they came from.  Those could be from anywhere.  Or anything.  Disgusting!"

Harry hurried to catch up with Doyle and tucked the handkerchief into his breast pocket as !e walked.  Doyle had stopped in front of a large door with a slider in it.  He rapped on it three times.

"So teeth you see fly out of someone's mouth do not bother you?  I can ask our medium friend who those came from if you would like."

Doyle gave Harry an irritated look and nodded shortly.  The plate in the door slid open and a man peered through.  "Arthur Doyle and guest," Doyle announced.

"Password?" said the figure behind the door.

"Greenfields," Doyle said.  The door plate slid closed and then there was a sound of multiple locks being turned.  The door opened and a thin man in a tight fitting black suit stood staring at them.  Harry bowed deeply and after a moment the man stepped to the side to let them pass.

Once inside the man shut the door and relocked it.  Harry watched automatically, cataloguing the various locks in his mind by type, manufacturer and time and tools required to open them.  The man caught him looking.

"You will be released in good time, sir.  Once you have what you came for."

Harry stared at the man, taking in the lines of his face, his red hair combed tightly against his head.  Like the locks, Harry mentally disassembled the parts of the man's face and catalogued them.  His eyebrows rose slightly.

Doyle handed his heavy jacket to the man in the tight suit and gestured for Harry to follow him.  The man reached out a hand but Harry waved him off.  "I like to keep my coat with me," he said.  Then added. "Miss."

A smile crossed the man...woman's face and her eyes crinkled with humor.  "Very perceptive, sir."  The smile reinforced Harry's conclusion.  He looked around the room noting a number of other "men" dressed similarly.  "All women?" he asked.

The woman in the black suit bowed slightly.  "The Spirits do not always respond well to the masculine energy," she said.

"Quite so," Harry said and turned to follow Doyle.
