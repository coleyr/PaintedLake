"Suus?" Michelle asked.  She cocked her head to one side.  "Not a common name around here."

"I'm not making it up."  Daniel waved his bucket-encased hand at Michelle.  "I thought you were going to take this plastic bucket off my hand."

"Are you bleeding?" Michelle asked.

"Um, no.  I don't think so," Daniel said, feeling along his wrist where it plunged into the opening in the side of the pail.

"Too bad.  A little blood and it would slide right off those toothpick arms."

"Hey!" Daniel yelled.  He clutched the bucket to his chest and wrapped an arm protectively around it.  "It's fine.  Never mind."

Michelle smirked.  This kid had practically punched through a brick wall, had actually punched through a metal pail, and had apparently crushed a door handle into a small ball in his panic.  And here she was less than a foot away insulting him, but then that had always been her response to fear--make the bastard fear you and not the other way around.

"I can't take you seriously with that bucket on your hand."  Michelle's hands shot out and grabbed the edges of the bucket.  She gave the pail a vicious tug and Daniel's hand slid out of the hole in the pail with a slight pop.

Michelle set the pail down.  "Close your eyes."

"Why?" Daniel asked warily, rubbing his wrist.

"I am going to put your glasses back on you so you don't get excited and accidentally rupture my spleen with more flailing around."

Daniel started to protest then sighed and nodded.  He was tired and just wanted to get out of this closet and away from this crazy girl.  Or at least that is what he thought he wanted until he felt her breath on his face as she knelt in front of him to put his glasses back on.  She smelled like cinnamon.  When he opened his eyes he could see again.  Her face was inches from his and she was peering at him like he was some sort of experiment or weird bug she had captured under a microscope.  She stared at him for another few seconds then sat back.  "You were telling me about a kid, Danny Boy" she said.

"Right," Daniel said.  "The kid."  He took a breath.  "I was there and I still don't know if it is a true story.  Rodney doesn't remember it this way, so maybe I made it up.  And there is no proof, like, really none.  I tried to check back later, but there was nothing.  Not even an obituary.  So this all may be some crazy lie that I made up because I was bored."

"But you don't think so," Michelle said.

"No," Daniel said.  He rubbed the bridge of his nose.  "I do.  By the way, do you need to sit so close?  I'm kind of claustrophobic."

Michelle smirked and Daniel immediately blushed realizing how it sounded.

"Okay," Michelle said, sliding back a little.  "Is this far enough that my feminine wiles won't ensnare your feeble brain?" Don't look at her breast! Daniel chided himself. More than once, he amended.  "Yes, that's far enough," Daniel said.

"So, my dad and his deputies do side work sometimes across the state line.  Mostly just county fairs.  Never anything big.  Dad says that the State cops take all the high paying side jobs, but a lot of people know him on that side of the line from when he was in the Four State Championship game in high school so he and his get a nod towards some of the medium level paying stuff."

Daniel did not have to say which sport his dad played or when he was in high school.  There had only ever been one "Dream Team" in the area ever and his dad had been captain of the basketball team that had taken the town "all the way across the Line".  Over the years a few Cruggwater Cretin teams had won the County Championship and one team about 12 years back had won tri-Country, but none within a 300 miles of Cruggwater had even come close to repeating that golden season.  No one even bothered to run against Sam Stowwater in the elections for sheriff anymore.

"My dad used to take me, and sometimes me and Rodney, with him.  Usually to the small county things because..." Daniel sighed, "even 25 years on people hold grudges or want to see if Dad 'still has it'.  At small county fairs everyone knows who is trouble and the local cops head it off before it gets out of hand.  But at bigger stuff like this my dad says you never know who is trouble until its too late to do anything but deal with them on their terms."

"I was supposed to be there, you know," Michelle said.

"Your parents could afford to take you through the front gate," Daniel said, smiling.  "So why--"

"John Suus," Michelle prompted.

"Yeah.  So, people always challenge Dad to stupid stuff like free throw contests or pick up games.  Dad doesn't play the games since his knees hurt now and no one usually will go up against him on free throws since he has cleaned out so many people now that now one is will to throw away good money."

"You dad never misses a shot, right?" Michelle asked.

Daniel nodded.  "Free throw.  He never missed a free throw.  He's okay to average (his words, not mine) on any other shot."

"That's why he was across to the other side the park when it happened," Daniel continued.  "You probably heard the story same as anyone else.  It was a freak thing.  They were changing the riders over when one car on the Positron broke loose and slid off.  It went past a hundred people--including me and Rodney.  Just swept by like a train before anyone knew what was happening.  Maybe that's what saved us all, no one had time to do something stupid like run and accidentally knock someone else into the car's path."

"Except John Suus," Michelle said.

"Except him," Daniel agreed.

"Except one kid who no one else remembers dying except you," Michelle added.

"I'm not making it up," Daniel said harshly.  "I know what I saw."

Michelle held up a hand.  "I didn't say I don't believe you."

Daniel scowled then shrugged.  "So the Positron car travels through a hundred people and no one gets a scratch.  People are all shocked and then every emotion is on display somewhere.  People laughing, people crying, somebody even was kissing.  Rodney and I laughed.  We were at the front of the spot where the car hit.  Rodney was sort of an accidental hero.  He stumbled and kicked some big rock and stubbed his toe, but it moved the rock just enough that when the car hit it it got deflected into the booth beside us and ricocheted down the line like a pinball, hitting and bouncing between building after building but never hitting one person."

"We were laughing and walking away when I, I guess heard something.  Not really heard, but felt a scream."

"You felt a scream," Michelle said incredulously.

"That's the only way I can describe it," Daniel said.  "And it was only me because I spun around and  looked and there was a kid about my age pounding on the Positron.  Nobody was paying much attention to him at first and then I started running toward the Positron and Rodney too.  'What are we doing?' I asked Rodney.  'Some kid is under that car,' he yelled.  'Where did he come from?'."

We got there and the kid--the one pounding the car, not the one under it--started trying to move it.  Rodney for once beat me to the punch and figured out what was going on and that there was someone under the car."

"Did Hell freeze over that day, too?" Michelle asked.

"Rodney has his moments," Daniel said defensively.  "Not many," he conceded after a second.

"Rodney yells 'Help me!' and we start trying to move that car.  Eventually some adults help us and the kid who keeps yelling 'John!' over and over again and we shift the car up and see what's underneath.  And then we all dropped it fast and backed away."

"What is gross?" Michelle asked.  She was twirling a finger through her hair nonchalantly but there was a tension in her tone.

Daniel nodded.  "Extremely.  The kid after seeing what's left of his friend under that car really starts to lose it.  He falls onto the ground and grabs at me trying to pull me down with him.  I flinch back but he still gets me and it's like iron on my leg.  Now I'm screaming and Rodney is yelling at the kid to calm down and trying to get the kid to tell him what happened."

"By then someone had gotten the police there and my dad was one of them.  People were starting to freak out because the ones that saw the body were telling other people and fights were breaking out.  Some people said they wanted to see if the kid was still alive, but I think maybe they just wanted to see the body.  It turned into chaos and police got wrapped up in that.  My dad looks at me over the crowd and gestures for me and Rodney to come and help him with the car so that he can get the body out."

"Rodney took off immediately towards my dad.  I couldn't move because the kid was holding me but my dad couldn't see the kid over all of the people between us.  My dad is screaming and waving me over and I am yelling back and trying to point at the ground."  Daniel paused.  "Then I saw it in his face.  'Coward', he was thinking.  He looked at Rodney running toward him and then back at me and then just turned away like he couldn't see me."

"That's harsh," Michelle said softly.  "What did he say when you told him afterwards?  Did Rodney..." she stopped.  "Rodney didn't remember it the same way you did?"

"He doesn't remember the kid," Daniel said bitterly.  It had been hotly debated by Daniel and Rodney later and neither had agreed with the other.  Rodney had been dead sure that there was no friend of the dead kid.  Daniel desperately needed there to have been to save face with his father.

Michelle waited.

Finally, Daniel said, "The sky was purple.  It was the middle of the day but I swear it was purple like a bruise.  The kid let me go after that and then started crying and said he had to get away from everything.  So I put my arm around him and shuffled him up to a hill that's near there.  The kid was blubbering on about his friend, John, and how John's brother had died recently and that this was going to kill John's mother."

"I could see Rodney and my dad down there helping people and dealing with the Positron car."

"Rodney?" Michelle said.

"Yep," Daniel said and smiled wanly.  "It was--well, my dad anyways said it was Rodney's finest hour." Bet that hurt, Michelle thought.

"Eventually one of the State cops came over and collected a statement from the kid and from me.  Got our name and addresses and told us not to leave the park.  As soon at the State leaves the kid has to go and find his other friend that is there and tell him John Suus is dead.  So I try to wave at my dad but he doesn't see me so I just go with the kid because I can't leave him alone like this.  We wandered for what must have been an hour or so until we finally find another kid that the friend of John recognizes. 'You have to tell him about John', he says, 'I can't!  I can't do it.'"

"So I go up to this other kid and on the way up there I am figuring out what to say."  Daniel was silent for a minute or two.

"And," Michelle prompted.

"And I screwed that one up, too.  First words out of my mouth: John Suus is dead, man.  Well, this guy is big and he wants to fight me until I point over my shoulder at John Suus' friend, the kid with the kung-fu iron grip.  And the big guy just knew.  I could see it in his face, like the whole world drained out of him.  He came and fetched his friend and two of them started screaming 'John Suus', over and over again and yelling up into the sky."

"What did you do then?" Michelle said.

Daniel shrugged.  He looked down.  "What could I do?  I left.  They had each other.  I went back but everything was wrapping up.  They even had that stupid Positron car on a flat bed and were towing it away.  A blanket over the body. I walk up to my dad.  I tried to tell him what happened but he doesn't even look at me.  Just tells me to go to the car until he and Rodney--Rodney!!--are done."

Daniel leaned back and sighed.  "I tried to find that kid later.  Tried everything I could think of.  Asked my dad to get the police report where I had been interviewed with that kid so that I could get his address or at least his name.  But there was no report filed.  When my dad asked him the State cop said he didn't know anything about two kids on a hill.  I checked newspaper articles here and even once snuck out of school and took a bus over to their grave yard to see if I could find John Suus's grave."

"Nothing," Michelle said.

Daniel laughed bitterly.  "Nothing."

"But you still believe it?" she asked.  "That is happened the way you said?"

"Yep," Daniel said and there was steel in his eyes.  "I do."

"So you want to help now with the murder because you didn't help then? You felt like Rodney stepped up and you didn't."

Daniel nodded vigorously.  "People said Rodney was like an angel.  He was everywhere all at once.  Had the answers--this WAS reported in their papers over there by the by: Boy Genius Saved Hundreds.  But I know Rodney--he could never do something like that.  I think he was possessed by angel."

"You know that possession is demons, right?  Not angels," Michelle replied.

"Then Rodney asked it in or something.  I don't know, but something happened that day and I wanted it to be me this time.  I want to be the guy people say is a 'Boy Genius'." Especially if one of those people is your dad, Michelle thought.

"Okay," she said, standing.  "Good enough."

Daniel looked confused.  "Wha--okay.  So I'm good?  To help find the killer?"

Michelle shrugged.  "It sounds like it's more about you and Daddy time, but if it solves the case then I don't care."

Daniel started to protest but Michelle waved it off and pulled on the door until it opened.  She started to step out then stopped and turned back.

"That kid was there, Daniel."

"How, how do you know that, Michelle?"

Michelle bit her bottom lip like she was carefully choosing her words.  "You said your dad didn't see you on the hill?"

"He didn't see me but it was a bit of a hike from the place where the car hit John Suus," Daniel said.

"And you didn't tell your dad about the hill?"  Michelle asked.  Daniel shook his head.  "Then how," Michelle continued, "would the State cop know that there WEREN'T two kids on a hill.  Why did the hill even come up?"

Daniel opened his mouth then closed it again then opened it.  Michelle winked at him.  "Think about it, Danny Boy."  And then she was gone.

 

Michelle waved to Rodney.  It was about an hour after she had kidnapped Daniel.  Rodney was standing next to his locker.  He checked around him to see who she was waving at then realizing there was no one else there gave a tentative wave back.  She smiled brightly and walked up to him and then kneed him hard in the groin.  He dropped to his knees and whimpered.

Michelle put a finger under his chin and lifted his face up towards her.  "There were two kids on that hill," she said and walked off down the hall.  "Try to remember that," she called over her shoulder.
