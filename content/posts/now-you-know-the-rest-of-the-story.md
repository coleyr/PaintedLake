To make a long story short, Dick Parnell (or "Prattling Parnell" as Michelle had named him) was a man of few words.  He had always been a man of few words.  Seldom was the day that you got any out of him.  The few you got were often clipped as if each syllable was gold and he was doling it out like a miser.  If he could use a contraction he would, if two words would suffice he would find a way to use one.

When his wife of 40 years had died on the operating table he had called each of his grandchildren individually,  said "Meemaw's not coming home," and hung up.   Dick Parnell did not waste time on good-byes.  The grandchildren would tell their parents when they got home that night.

Then Dick had gone out to weed his extensive garden ("Plants're quiet").  The grandchildren who had been unlucky enough to pick up the phone when he called were either reduced to great heaving sobs (Estelle had been a favorite grandparent to many).  Others just gave a "cool" and then they went back to their video game, or comic, or phone call with their friends on the other line (because old people tended to die a lot).  His children had frantically begun calling each other, trying to piece together the details, as the stories and half answers were pried from sobbing kids, sullen teenagers, and the irritated hospital staff.

Jersey Winn, Parnell's oldest granddaughter, lived in New York City.  That was a place Dick hated to think about.  He could hear all the noise of the place just through the phone line when Jersey called.  She called a lot.  She wanted him to visit New York City.  What he did not know was that his granddaughter suspected he would kick her lazy ass husband in the butt and tell him to get a job.  Dick would inadvertently broach an uncomfortable subject--that the Joey Winn's business, whatever it was this month, wasn't taking off and maybe it was time to get a real job.  Then she and Joey could have a heart to heart.  (Joey Winn's business was actually selling marijuana, but even in that he had only been able to get one customer.  Still it covered his own use so why expend unnecessary energy.)

Parnell only called during the day because Jersey was at work and so would not be there to pick up the phone.  Her idiot husband let it ring through to the message machine usually, so Parnell just needed to suffer through the 15 seconds from Jersey telling him to leave a message that she would get back "right quick".  And she did.  Jersey always called back, always talked a mile a minute, always held Parnell on the phone for hours while she chatted away about everything and nothing.   Though he would never admit it to himself Jersey was the only one he liked in the entire family, including his own kids.  She was never offended because he grunted responses.  She never cared that he had nothing to say.  Truth be told, if he thought he could have handled New York City, he would have gone there and punched her druggie husband right in the gut and told him to "Get a job or get out!".  A lot a words but sometimes you had to spend them out to get through to chuckleheads like Joey.  'Course Jersey still being with the louse was living proof that hundreds of thousands of words didn't get through to some people.

Parnell did not think about Jersey if he could because more than once he had found himself at the bus station looking at the ticket counter.  The garden store was right across from the depot.  His feet just seemed to take him there sometimes.

Unfortunately, for Joey Winn on this particular day he had picked up the phone when Parnell called with the news about Estelle.  Joey had been waiting for a call from his dealer and was annoyed to hear the gravely voice of his nagging wife's grandfather on the line.  Joey had been to Jersey's hometown once, right after they got married, since they could not afford a honeymoon (until his reusable sheetrock business took off).  It had been a rotten trip and he had only been able to score some overpriced skank weed off of Jersey's teenage cousin.  It barely got him high.  The old man, Prattling Parnell (who came up with the nickname), did not say two words to him, only stared at him like he wanted to punch Joey.  Punch him a couple of times in fact.  Jersey doted on the crotchety old man even though the rest of the family clearly saw what Joey did.  He was a Grade A butt face.

"Meemaw's not coming home," the Grade A butt face said through the phone.

Joey was a little slow this morning.  "Huuuuhhh?" he said.

Dick Parnell paused mid-hang up.  The idiot husband hadn't got the message.  G.D. junkies!  Maybe he should just hang up.  Jersey and Estelle hadn't liked each other for some reason Parnell had never been able to figure out.  Still if anyone deserved to not be the last to know family business it was Jersey.  She was...different.  Parnell spent a lot of time in the garden or out walking his land, yet still he always happened to be near the phone when she called.  For the briefest of seconds, he wondered if there was something to that.  Did he have a favorite?

Well, he had sat there more than once, listening while she cried herself empty in loud New York City.  Grunted negatively when she chastised herself for being weak--which by God she wasn't.  Not at all!  Most of the people in the town--including him--never moved away.  Dreams, ambitions, all of it came and went.  Getting out of the town was like swimming through molasses.  Failing to get out was practically a right of passage.  Still she did it and she kept at it even though he knew the draw to come back was always strong.  Not weak at all.  No, sir.

Dick Parnell reached deep down inside himself for the strength to deal with her idiot husband.  He gathered up one more, completely unnecessary, completely wasted word.

"Dead," he said, then hung up.

Joey Winn stared at the phone as his mind tried to process.  Who was dead?  As soon as he put down the phone it rang.  He picked it up tentatively.  Had the old Grade-A called back?

"Hello?" Joey said cautiously.

"Joey Winn.  Winn you been, man?"

Joey sighed with relief.  It was his best (and only) customer, Craig.  They had grown up together but now the guy was a local politician like in the State Senate or city planning or something.  Maybe Craig was an actual Senator for New York.  No wait that was...  Joey had seen Craig on TV.  He did not sound like he did when he called Joey.  There he sounded official and serious, talking about the dangers of "drugs in our community".  Maybe he liked Joey because he knew Joey was not a cop.

"I think somebody died," Joey said.  "Jersey's family," he added quickly.  "No one important.  I think."

"Okay," Craig said after a minute.  "Cool.  Well, let's talk business, baby.  Oh and how's that hot wife of yours?"

"Funny," Joey muttered.  "You want the usual amount?"
