Zeb trotted along beside Allison, always out of step with the group. It was distracting Michael so much he couldn't tell if he was outwardly wincing watching Zeb's strange elliptical orbit around TA. He wasn't sure if Zeb was being intentionally obtuse in his walking or if he was genuinely incapable of matching pace. Maybe one leg was too long? Was he limping? Every thirty steps he circled behind and went over to walk around Ellory then circled back to Tiny Allision. The most peculiar thing about arriving in a moment is that it is feels like watching a movie. Choosing when to start and when to leave are lingering options and are hard to completely ignore when someone's presence is so irritatingly felt. Most moments are built around us and electing the beginning of a moment is left to our brains unreliable mechanisms for recognizing importance. In some cases we fall out of practice of trying to separate life's white noise from the story worthy pieces, but not in high school, and not with theater kids.

"I think I would want 'Thinker, Hoper, and Feeler' on my tombstone" Tiny Allison said ernestly, the way one might in job interview or on a television show. Zeb laughed facetiously, he had a knack towards blindness only to his own incredulous hyper serious behavior.

"'Hoper' isn't even a real word. And what makes one a feeler?" Zeb posited while straightening an ill fitted sports coat.Â  "If you could dig a little deeper in your indubitably flawed voca-"

"Listen!" TA Squeeked. "you can pick your own tombstone saying, and maybe it won't be something stupid. But it probably will be stupid. Because you dress like House and pretend to have a limp because you think that's cool and somehow you think everyone else thinks it's cool."

"I don't care what everyone else thinks" Zeb said while suddenly walking normally.

"What about you E?" Michael asked.

"Uhm, well baring the fact I am not gonna die because that's scary. I don't think I would want a stone, maybe like a sign or something." Ellory said twisting here hair.

"What would it say?" TA asked.

"Dear Ellory in big letters with the dates, again not dying ever, and then have a little box for letters and stuff" Ellory said nodding to herself designing it in her mind.

Zeb chortled but then abruptly stopped when three eyes shot daggers into his dumb round face.

"And you?" Ellory said nudging Michaels arm.

"I like your plan of not dying for a start, but if I had to pick, I think I would go with one of those ditch lights from old timey movies, a lot of eager shoppers looking for bargains on used sedans would show up at my grave and then probably be upset." Michael said mulling over the logistics of powering the light and considering the budgets and wiring of graveyards.

"That's cool" Zeb said coyly realizing he couldn't always be condescending, or just because he wanted to say something as he swallowed tick-tacs from an orange pill bottle.

"Ok next one is... 'Do you think that Fate is real?' and not just like you will marry so and so or get rich or whatever but do you think anything is up to chance?" Allison posited the grand question from her tiny person.

"NO" Zeb said coldly in as self assured manner as could be mustered when in costume.

"Ok, what about you Allison?" Ellory asked after a moment of waiting for elaboration.

"I asked the question, I spent all that brain power thinking up a good question, I need you chumps to answer it while I think of a good answer!" Allison said hurriedly. "Your up Michael" Ellory said nudging his arm once again. Michael thought hard for a moment, but then, as if someone coughed in the back row of the theater, he was reminded it was only a movie.

"There has got to be chance. I think that's what makes life exciting, we don't know what's gonna happen." The man from the future said carelessly.
