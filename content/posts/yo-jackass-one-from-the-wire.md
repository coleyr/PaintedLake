Yo Jackass,

Tim from the Dispatch.  Remember that small town discovered empty in the Mid West a few years back.  Someone finally finished digging through it and wrote it up.  Came in on the international wire weirdly enough.  But too late to make our night run.  Bill told me to shoot it your way before I open it up to the highest bidder. 1 photo that I'll send over if you take the piece.  Looks too grainy to be useful but maybe your layout guys and design nerds can get creative.

You got 30 minutes, homeboy, then Im opening it up.

oh Bill says to tell Syd: "Debt paid in full with this.  Screw you and screw the Lakers."  Speaking of bets, you make any headway with that hot piece of ass that started a few months back?  haha  Business suit girl.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dec 9th 1993 -- Deborah Grover, Michael Penrose with assistance from Reggie MacTierney When you die what will go in that box of "stuff" that describes your life?  When a person dies family is given the unenviable job of cleaning out your flat (hopefully with you already having been removed from it.)  It is their duty to sort through what you kept from all of the things that passed through your hands throughout your life.  What will the things someone packs in a box say about the life you lived?  What will it say about you? The nation was captivated three years ago when the town of Atonville was discovered completely empty.  It started with unanswered letters and answering machines that became too full to record.  Eventually, people outside of the town began trying to get in contact with their relatives' neighbors and then eventually the local authorities. The mysterious disappearance of more than 1,500 people made headlines but was quickly lost.  There was a deluge of the international and national headlines dominating the news cycle that week.  Even in regional papers the extended coverage was limited to a few, terse sentences buried midway through the Front or Local sections. Though he did not realize it at the time, the first person to physically set foot in the town was Reggie McTierney, a British journalist on vacation in the US.  According to MacTierney, his family's travel route passed through Atonville.  He found no one in the town or surrounding county.  It was odd but he was not on assignment.  He "procured" a few letters to obtain the return address of family members.  After arriving in California a few days later he began to make calls. What he discovered is that in spite of numerous attempts to contact people in the town by phone or letter the 4-5 people he spoke with had not gone to the town to investigate personally.  MacTierney was a sports writer so he turned the "odd little piece" over to his International desk when he returned to the UK. Hundreds of friends and relatives of people in the town were eventually interviewed. But even people in the adjacent counties never "got around" to making the short trip.  Something always came up.  Deliveries for the town piled up at receiving sites in adjacent counties or returned to the original shippers.  External vendors with relationships to local retailers had no explanation for why they had let their relationships lag and the accounts receivables go uncollected. MacTierney was asked to go back with three journalists from the International desk the following month.  The trip was delayed.  The UK made it into the Cricket World Cup semi-finals and then finals.  MacTierney and the correspondents from the International desk were busy covering that story.  It was well over a year before the team would travel to Atonville.  Much had changed in that time. The town had significantly deteriorated.  Sinkholes had opened and swallowed entire buildings.  Trees had fallen across the major thoroughfare in numerous places, restricting travel to some sections of town.  Electricity was off in most buildings and there were signs of a large fire in one section.  The church bell tower had partially collapsed causing the bell to be in a position where is rang continuously during a strong wind. In every relatively unscathed building visited there were no signs of struggle or abduction.  No chairs had been tipped over.  No doors showed signs of forced entry.  Nothing had been looted and electronics still sat covered with dust. In a word it was eerie. The town's residents had just ceased being in the town--except in one house.  The residence of the Danforths (as identified by their collected mail) showed signs that someone had been packing.  There were a few suitcases out, partially filled with clothes and toiletries.  A rather large bushman's blade had been set by the front door.  Opened on desk was a single box containing a few small items...

T-Dog,

Yeah, remember the story, but thought the place was called Sugar Cove or something.  I'll have Copy check it.  Syd says we'll take it but to put it in your desk drawer and give us a day or two.  A lot of popup local stuff coming in unexpectedly.

By the way, bet's done.  Looks we'll be buying the rounds this year.  (NO TOP SHELF!!) Long story short: Turns out Desiree is a lesbo.  Worked her for a month before she finally broke down and admitted it.  Swore me to secrecy so of course I told all the other guys so they wouldn't waste time on her.  Haha  Apparently she heard about it but didn't seem upset.  With a name like that and those tits she is probably used to it.

-- Jack B Dear Ma'am,

We came across this old email thread in the archived servers while we were purging. 

Due to the offensive nature of some of its content, as per company policy, I have placed "xxxx" over offensive words before sending.  I was unsure whether I should remove what apparently is a reference to you.

I sincerely and profusely apologize if I have made an incorrect choice, but your instructions regarding any written or electronic communications of Mr. Bonneville and your predecessor, Mr. Sydney Stanwick, are still active policy in my department.

There is a news article referenced in the email.  Mr. Bonneville's replacement searched her desk and found a printed copy of the article wedged behind one of the drawers.  (Security apparently missed the paper when they were cleaning it out after you terminated Mr. Bonneville.)

Please let me know how to proceed.

Director of IT Dhruv,

Thank you for forwarding that on.  FYI, you are the hero of the week over here.  I shared it with some others who were around during Mr. Bonneville's time.  We all got a real kick out of it.

You can toss the article.  I vaguely remember it hitting the national cycle the first time but if anyone had discovered something interesting about the town it would have ended up back in the news cycle.

On a personal note, my husband and I enjoyed meeting you and your spouse at the New Years Eve party.  Let us hope that the 2000's bring us a different world than the one with which we all started.
