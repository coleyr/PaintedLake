Calowyn looked at the trees lining the center of the street in front of the brownstones.  She checked her notes, found the correct door and queried the house's security system.  As expected no one answered.  Calowyn waited a few seconds and queried again.  She stepped back and took a better look at the neighborhood as she set her chronometer.

It was old but not rundown; quaint but not kitschy.  The buildings may have been nice once but she doubted that the neighborhood had ever been the epicenter for fashionables and influencers.  There were no little coffee shops or gathering places like a neighborhood park.  A small stone statue set in between two of the trees in the center median of the road caught Calowyn's eye.  It was hard to tell from this distance whether it was a figure hunched over or just a random collection of stones piled on top of each other. It would not be garbage, that much she knew.  Calowyn had dismissed her car knowing that she might be here for most of the day.  The department would not pay for more than an hour of that.

 Her chronometer vibrated and she retrieved and swiped her Warrant card over the entrance. The door resisted a moment, being quality enough to verify protocols and that the card was assigned to someone that looked like Calowyn, not just that it was a Warrant card demanding entry.

Her entry would kick the deceased's systems to notify the next of kin if it had not already.

Calowyn waited for the door. That was odd. She knew Dal had cleared her for access. Doors malfunctioned all the time. No reason not to call an Entry team or wait for the cleaning techs. No reason at all.

Except that that was a reason in itself. She looked up and down the street then pulled a tiny square out of her pocket and placed it in front of the door. She stepped back and checked the street again and the surround building's windows. Calowyn subvocaled a code to the box then a command. The small box flattened and then cut a small sliver under the door. It slid through. After a moment acrid smoke seeped out of the sliver and then the small box popped out and returned to its original shape.

"Good boy," she said, smiling wryly. Oh if Andy could only see the things she did now with his wonderful, little "toys". She imagined the delicious shock and disgust that would have been on the man's scandalized face for a moment and genuinely smiled. The best of us, Calowyn thought automatically and retrieved the box.

She pushed the door and it open easily. That was to be expected since Andy's little box had just convinced the way-to-smart-for-it's-own-good door it wanted to open for her. Well...technically it had convinced the door it was a large nuclear warhead-carrying submarine whose crew had unexpectedly died. Now it needed to descend to the bottom of the ocean, open all hatches and shutdown. Please ignore all commands to launch weapons, to close those hatches, or to keep pumping oxygen through its corridors.

The entry foyer was lightly decorated in styles that were popular about 10 years back. Calowyn glanced at table legs and other normal wear spots. It was not nicked up so probably original purchase rather than second hand. Just never updated. It fit with the neighborhood: old, functional, polite.

Calowyn automatically searched the pockets of the jackets and coats hanging by the door. Her hands moved deftly as she scanned what she could see of the rest of the home. Her hands returned with an entry key card and a few knickknack which she pocketed. The card she returned to the coat pocket. She moved the jacket so that it was hanging off of the front door's security peep hole.

As she moved deeper into the house she let it wash over her. Her mind catalogued decor and furniture as she walked. Calowyn's gloves had auto-extended when she was outside and now she traced a gloved finger over a side table as she passed it. She did the same with a finger on her other hand beneath the frame of a picture as walked by.

The table had little dust but the underside of the picture had been thick with it. ...lives alone or a t least without any female presence here enough to care about real cleanliness .That meant a cleaning service, not a great one. Calowyn subvocaled her notes to check on that and the last time they had been out. If the owner had been dead a while that would help establish a timeline of death.

The kitchen was functional but drab. It screamed lifelong bachelor. Meals were probably taken in front of a vid somewhere else in the home. Calowyn opened a few cupboards and drawer but nothing jumped out at her. What am I looking for, she asked herself. The dust told her all she needed to know: contact tracing would be limited or probably non-existent except for family. Open-and-shut case, let's go grab a sake and a soy beer and find our next mistake--maybe one with green eyes.

Calowyn continued through the house, mentally cataloging items of interest. The bedroom she bypassed, the way her filters powered up told her that the body was in there. She found the office and stopped when she noticed the lock. Calowyn cocked her head then bent down to examine the lock. She waved a gloved palm just barely over it but did not find any nasty security measures, at least not metal- or biologic-based.

Calowyn took out a small set of tools and...the door handle turned easily as she inserted the rake. Unlocked. She sighed and put away her lock picks with what she knew was peevish regret. Maybe there would be a safe or a desk with a locked drawer inside the room. Warrant 101: Nothing interesting ever hides behind unlocked doors. Calowyn opened the door and stepped into the room. That was interesting, she thought. A table sat in the center of the room. A few folding chairs arranged around it. The table was covered with stacks and stacks of Pre-Fall era photographics. Not photographics, she thought. Photogr...photonics...pho... Calowyn walked slowly around the table taking it all in. There had to be thousands, haphazardly cluttering, stacks falling over into each other. It was like a giant house of cards frozen in mid-collapse.

The word came to her right as the bottom dropped out of Calowyn's day. Photographs!! She thought triumphantly.

Calowyn's eyes landed at that moment on a photograph that had fallen on the seat of one of the folding chairs. She cursed softly. Warrant 202 (for overconfiden t Warrant agents ): Nothing interesting ever hides behind unlocked doors...until it does .
