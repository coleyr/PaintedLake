Jersey was tired as she trudged down the walk toward her apartment.  The bus had broken down.  It was hot and the other bus took--well, complaining was not going to help, Jersey thought to herself.  She had a job.  She was healthy.  A lot of people had it worse than her.

She knew that because she carted them to and from work, to and from the doctors, to and from their lives.  Route 216, driver 3931, that was the 30 feet of steel Jersey kept clean, safe and happy for her riders. A lot of the other drivers did not like her she knew.  Jersey always showed up to work an hour early to clean her assigned bus for the day.  She rubbed down the surfaces with antibacterial wipes since a lot of her mid-day riders were elderly.  The cleaning crew missed a lot of common area surfaces.  Sometimes the seats of that day's bus had tears in them which could catch on skirts or hosiery so she tapped them up with duct tape.

This afternoon she had organized the younger riders to fan the older ones in the sweltering heat.  That she just happened to place Sally Pertikins and Fred (he never gave a last name) together to fan Mrs. Evelyn (husband deceased 3 years) was just a coincidence.  That Jersey had watched Sally shoot furtive glances at Fred for months now and that Fred was getting over a bad divorce (because his wife cheated on him) was also not relevant to who she assigned where.  Mrs. Evelyn seemed to think differently though because she smiled conspiratorially at Jersey and winked when Sally and Fred got paired up.  Fred was a favorite.

Once Fred's ex-wife had had the audacity to use 216 to get to and from the apartment of the jerk she was cheating on Fred with!  Mrs. Evelyn (wears purple on days she feels good) had accidentally tripped the jerk cheater once while he was getting on the bus, causing him to break his nose and sprain his wrist.  He tried to get off, but Jersey unfortunately had a "route to keep" and she could not open the doors while the bus was moving or make unauthorized stops just for him.  She accidentally missed all of her stops after that and it took an hour of "searching" for her to find the where she had gotten lost.

The poor jerkface cheater had grumbled the whole way, but Fred's cheating wife had gotten the message.  Looking around for sympathizers at this crazy bus driver she had only found cold stares.  Mrs. Evelyn had sweetly asked after Fred, leaving no doubt in the cheater wife's mind what was going on.  Jersey had gotten in trouble for that one and quite a few of her route passengers that had gotten missed or picked up late.  They were angry the next day when they boarded the bus.  But by the time they got off no one was mad.  Mr. Bowinger even said being late to work had been a blessing because he had run into an old friend on the replacement bus that was sent to pick him them all up.  Not one person was mad at her by the time they got off the bus.  A few even laughed about hoping she "did not stay too late cleaning up blood stains" and winking at her.

The written reprimand for Jersey's permanent file never came though.  Her supervisor had been angry about that.  "Perfect Prattling Jersey got away with it somehow," she had overheard her boss gripe in the breakroom.  Sometimes a girl just got lucky.

Jersey had wondered about her favorite city councilman, but he had not been on this week.  Craig was a once-a-week rider though she knew he lived in a different part of the city.  She was careful around him because he was the head of the Transportation Board and her upper management were terrified of upsetting him.  He was an odd one, always rode to the same stop and was there for pick up the next time she rolled up.  He said he had a friend nearby, probably a woman knowing these politicians.  He was probably the  nightmare for some other "Fred".

Jersey stopped at the trash can beside the stoop and lifted the lid.  A common complaint the tenants had with the City was that the garbage crew disputed whether it was their responsibility to walk up the steps and empty the can.  Jersey hated conflict so she had decided to just do it herself.  No one ever used it except the smokers to toss their cigarette butts in and as she lifted the lid up she saw that apparently been a while since anyone--tenant or crew--had emptied it.  Jersey slammed the can lid down and covered it instinctively.  There was a little baggie of marijuana in there.  She knew Joey smoked marijuana but she could not imagine he would be tossing it in here.  Especially not a full baggie's worth.  That stuff was gold to him.

She looked around and then opened the lid, there were actually two bags in there.  She pulled off the lid and moved a few of the butts around with her umbrella (always be prepared, Dick Parnell Rule 101).  She found more.  A lot more.  It took her twenty minutes of digging but she found almost 18 bags.  She tried to think back.  Those had not been in there the last time she had emptied the can.  Or had they?  She thought back to when she had last emptied the can.  Since it was only cigarette butts and the odd can of soda here and there it took a while to fill up.  Eighteen bags, eighteen weeks.  Jersey had seen cop shows and knew sometimes drug dealers left drugs at "pick up" spots.  Surely Joey was not so stupid as to have his dealers drop off his drugs in front of their home--no, and besides Joey would have collected these by now.  They must belong to someone else.

Jersey quickly gathered up the bags and dashed around to the back of the apartment building.  As she expected, Woody, the homeless guy who sometimes slept on the back stoop was there.  He looked up suddenly when she came running around then relaxed when she saw it was her.

"You got a sandwich for me, little Miss?" he chuckled.

She ran up to him, close to him, "Woody, I need help!"

She was uncomfortably close she knew, Woody did not like to be touched.  She had once seen him fight three police officers trying to take him away to a shelter on one brutally cold night.  If she had not offered to ride in the back of the police car with him and get him settled in at the shelter she doubted he would have gone.

"Wha--"

"Look down my shirt!" she said.  His jaw dropped.  "Please, everyone already thinks you're a pervert," she begged.

"My damn belt broke--"

"Please," she said again looking around and up at the windows of the apartments surrounding the small entry way.

Slowly, he pulled her shirt forward and looked down then jumped back.

"That's a lot of weed there, girl.  You need a lot more breasts to all hide that."

"Hey!" she said, the drug momentarily forgotten.  Her cup size was a sore subject between her and Joey.  So much so that she had considered getting breast implants like her grandmother Estelle was...actually should have gotten earlier this morning.  Jersey made a mental note to call her grandfather and check on her grandmother.

"I need you to get rid of these," she said.

"You want me to take those?" Woody said, carefully.  "Can I look down your shirt again?"

"No!" Jersey said.

"I need to check you for a wire," he said.  "You could be narc-ing me out.  Maybe your boy, Joey, got caught dealing and you're selling up a bigger fish."

Jersey stared at Woody blankly.  Dealing?  Joey didn't deal.  Did he?

"Fine, check," Jersey said.  "Then take these and get rid of them."

Woody checked, a bit longer than Jersey thought necessary, but once he was satisfied he held his hands out for the drugs.

"Thank you!" she said gratefully.  "I owe you one."

"I think we're more than even, little Miss," Woody winked.  He trotted off whistling.

When she got into her apartment Jersey closed the door and leaned on it exhausted.  Between work and the frantic energy of the last few minutes she was spent.  A hot bath was definitely in her future.

"Hey, babe," Joey said, not looking up from the marijuana cigarette he was rolling.

"You won't believe the day I had, baby," Jersey said.  Maybe, just maybe she could get a backrub out of him.

"Umhmm," Joey said.  He reached for a lighter and lit his marijuana cigarette.

"The bus broke down and we had to wait for Sanjiv's 218 to get rerouted and I found 18 G.D bags of marijuana in the trash can outside."

That got his attention.  Joey's head shot up.  "What?  Where?  Outside?"

"Yes! Can you bel--" Joey was up and moving before she even had time to register it.  She barely managed to out of his way before he tore the door open.

"Baby!  Baby!  Wait, it's gone, it's gone!"

He was halfway out the door.  He spun around.  "Wait?!  How?"

Jersey waived him closer since he was standing in the hall.  "I gave it to Woody to get rid of."

He stared at her dumbstruck.  "Woody, the bum?"  She nodded and his face changed.  "You stupid idiot!  Do you know how much that was worth?"

Jersey stared at him.  "Baby, that is not nice."  Joey visibly struggled to restrain himself.

"Fine, which way did he go?  Maybe I can get him to give me half," Joey said.  He reached inside for his shoes by the door.

"Joey," Jersey said.  "Are you a dealer?"

Joey looked up but did not stop tying his shoes.  "What?  No.  Well, to one guy but he's an old friend."

"Do you deal to kids?" Jersey asked.

"No, just one guy.  I just charge him enough of a margin to cover my own weed expenses," Joey said.  He stood.  "Which way did Woody go?"

Margin? Expenses?  Joey had a business degree from college but he had never used those words in any conversation with her.  "You've put a lot of thought into that business," she said softly.

"Which way did Woody go, Jerz?  Hey, wake up, McFly.  This is important!"

Jersey slugged him in the stomach.  Hard.  Jersey had never hit anyone before in her life and she felt guilt the second she did it.  She opened her mouth to apologize.

Joey was on the ground, clutching his stomach.  "I'm glad your grandfather's dead, you bitch!"

Jersey's words died on her tongue.  She only had one living grandfather.  "What?"

Joey waived his hand towards the apartment.  "Earlier.  Call.  Gees, you punched me, Jerz!"

Jersey turned around and closed the door.  She locked the deadbolt and shoved the lock plate into place.  She walked over to the couch and sat down.  Grampy Parnell dead.  Joey had returned the punch with interest.  Interest, she thought, that is a business word I know.  I'm not stupid.

Outside she could her Joey pounding on the door.  The phone rang.  It would be her father, maybe, or her mother calling to talk about Grampy.  Probably to gloat.  They all hated him for some reason.  She let the answering machine get it as she and started locking all the windows.  Her own chirpy voice nattered out of the speaker at her then a man's voice came on.  Strangely familiar.

"Yo, Winn, it's Craig.  I can't make it out today, dude.  Bus never showed.  Just hold my stash til tomorrow.  Better watch that hot little wife of yours."

Jersey picked up the phone.  "Who is this?"

"Jersey?" the man said, all 'street' attitude gone.  He sounded shocked and a little scared.

"Is this Craig...from the bus?  From the City?"

And suddenly all the pieces came together.  The weekly rides, always taking the standing spot near the front "because he sat too much all day", the constant attempts to make her laugh, that he was a recent divorcee like Fred and so he "sympathized with the poor bastard", the discarded drugs outside.  Even the lack of reprimand at work.

"You don't even smoke marijuana, do you?" she said.

"No," he said.  "Not since I was a 16."

"Kids could have gotten those," she said.

"I know, but I couldn't figure out a way to--"

"That was really irresponsible," she said.  She tried to picture his face from the bus.  He was not a frequent rider so it too a moment.

He was silent, waiting.  "I'm sorry," he said finally.  "That was reckless."

"How long have you been doing it?" she asked.  Jersey sat down on the couch.  Joey was still in the hall yelling and pounding on the door in the background.  She would have to address that soon.

"Four years," Craig said.  He sounded sad.  Jersey looked down over the table of drugs and cigarette rolling supplies.

"I'm calling the police," she yelled at Joey.  The pounding and yelling stopped.

"Okay," Craig said simply, "I understand.  How much was there?"

She started to tell him she was talking to Joey then instead just said "about 20 bags.

Craig whistled.  "Yes, that will be some time."  He sighed.  "Okay.  I need to take responsibility.  Here, I'll give you my address so you can tell the Police where--"

"I got rid of the bags," she said.  "I gave them to a homeless guy I know."

"That was really irresponsible," he said and she could tell he was smiling.  She smiled.

"Do you want to get laid?" Jersey said suddenly.

"With you?" he said hopefully then groaned.  She could tell he regretted that comment and for some reason that made her smile even wider.

"Be here in 20 minutes," she said and hung up without saying goodbye.

She would have to deal with Joey.  She would have to call her cheating jerk grandmother who was probably already out using her new breast implants if Grampy was dead.  She would probably be out even if he was alive.

"Woody went towards 54th," she yelled.  After a moment Joey stomped off, presumably to get his "gold".

Of course, Jersey reflected, she was still a married woman and about to have a man over that was not her husband.  So maybe she and Estelle were not so different.  I told you I wasn't strong like you, Grampy.  She wished suddenly Grampy could have met Mrs. Evelyn.

Jersey stood up, realizing she was still in her bus driver's uniform.  She needed a dress.  And a shower.  And maybe, yes, yes, that one bit of lingerie she had bought but never gotten around to wearing for Joey.

Craig was just a distraction.  Probably.  She would have to deal with Grampy's death, Joey, all it but not tonight.  She unplugged the phone and turned off the answering machine.

She smiled as she pulled lingerie out of her drawer.  They were gold, too.
