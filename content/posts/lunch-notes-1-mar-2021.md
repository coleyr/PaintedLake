The diner is in the nexus of 5 demi-god territories.  A neutral ground but also a place that was to be the center of a new territory being carved out for a 6th demigod (the Man in the Salt Shaker/"Big Man Little Salt Shaker").  Minty Nose-y and the rival demi god are active participants since they imprisoned the Salt Shaker Man, but the other three are accomplices to varying degrees (passive support, active ignorance, intentional misinformation back to the Ministry of Territories).

The Man's presence though is what allows Michelle and the rest of the ASMC to break free of the spell by degrees.  Also Michelle's unintentional/unplanned status as Minty Nose's high priestess gives her some immunity.

Minty Nose-y has had the death rate stalled or at least exactly equivalent to the birth rate for years to keep the town from eroding over time like other nearby territories.  He has also developed archetypes (i.e., Michelle is the town Bitch, Sarah is the town's Prom Queen, etc.)  Until recently he has only needed to influence the speaker which is a minor draw on power for him as it is easier to control what a single speaker says vs. the hearing and/or perception of multiple listeners.  Once Michelle and crew begin breaking archetype they don't "say" what they should or say things the way they "should".  So Minty has to draw extensive power from him own realm to influence all of the listeners/watchers.  But that begins to deconstruct his mini-realm (i.e., walls in one of his rooms in his domain completely disappear or are only half built).

One convention we can use is "italics of the listener".  Character speaks and we write the same thing in italics for the next sentence as what the listener hears.  Then as the power draws start happening in the plot we make it seem like a mistake at first/crappy book editing.  The italics is missing key punctuation at one point then we do it again but more pronounced like with missing a word or two and then eventually the italics has a blatant misrepresentation of what the speaker said or did.
