Velsa led Harry and Doyle to a room they had not been in before.  If appeared to be a storage room for props for the seances.  Exotic costumes, crystal balls and candles were everywhere.  Harry picked up a thick bound tome.  He peered at it queerly and tossed it from hand to hand a few times.

"Hollow?" he asked Velsa.  She nodded.

She sat down at a large table--most likely a spare for the table in the main room--and pulled the out from beneath it.  She placed it on the table and gestured for them to sit.

Harry took a seat and nodded to the camera.  "May I?"  Velsa nodded and he slid it in front of he and Doyle.

"You will find nothing inside that is different from any other camera of similar design," Velsa said.  "In truth, my family and I do not know why it works, only that it does."

"Magic?" Harry asked sarcastically.

Doyle opened the camera with a practiced ease.  He examined the inside carefully and prodded a few components.  He closed it and pushed it back to Velsa.

The three sat in silence for a moment, watching the camera.

"I want to use it again," said Harry.  "What else can it show us?"

"Normally, just a soul," said Velsa.

"A soul?!" exclaimed Doyle.

Velsa leaned forward.  "Yes, lost soldier.  What you saw was also new to me.  In the past, it was only a person's soul, never an event in time."

"Why a soul?" asked Harry.  "What use is that?"

"Do you believe in Heaven, Magician?"

"In theory," replied Harry, sitting back and crossing his arms.

"In practice," Doyle corrected with a stern look.  "You believe in practice, Harry."

"Quite so," Harry agreed, but looked less than convinced.

"People come to us sometimes with pictures of their dead loved ones.  They want to know if their soul was pure enough to enter Heaven or advance on the Great Wheel and so on."  Velsa retrieved a photograph from her pocket.

"May I see that?" Harry asked.

Velsa shoved it into a slot in the camera.  "The time for healthy skepticism is during my working hours, Mr. Houdini."  She faced the camera lens at a sheet hanging from a nearby wall and turned it on.  A slightly blurry figure appeared on the wall.  It was possible to make out that the figure facing the camera was in uniform: a soldier or possibly a policeman or fireman.

"This was left behind by one of my clients.  It is her son who died in the war."  Velsa adjusted the focus until his face was clear.  It was young soldier in his late teens or very early twenties.

Doyle stood up and walked over to the sheet.  "Enlisted.  American," he said.

"Yes," Velsa said.  She twisted a knob on the camera.  The image wavered then became just a thin black silhouette of the soldier filled with white and dark patches.

"His...'soul'?" Harry asked.

"That or perhaps his ledger would be more accurate," Velsa responded.

"What are these spots?" Doyle asked indicating the dark patches in the silhouette.

"Stains or maybe holes." Velsa leaned back in her chair.  She retrieved a cigarette and placed it in a long holder.

"What is that?"  Doyle asked pointing to a wide slash running across one side of the soldier's silhouetted chest.  "Is there a...is that a face?"

"A face, yes," Velsa said quietly.  "It is someone he killed."

"Killed?" said Doyle, dubiously.  "Soldiers kill each other all of the time.  Even as fresh-faced as he is he would have had more than one killed if he was at the Front for longer than a few weeks."

"Those are the stains or holes on what would be his right side," Velsa said. "We carry the world on our right, our family is closer to the left.  Near our heart."

Doyle traced his hand over maybe twenty or thirty spots.  "Active little bugger.  How long was he at the Front?"

Velsa shrugged.

Harry pointed to the swash of dark on the soldier's left.  "Who is the face?  On his left."

Velsa shrugged again and took a long drag on her cigarette.  "I do not know.  But his mother did.  She left quickly after."

"Leaving behind one of the few pictures she had of her son?" Harry said skeptically.

"That is the face of a grown man," Doyle said, pointing at the small image on the soldier's left side.  "Can you shift it back to the photograph?"

Velsa turned the knob taking it from a silhouette to a photograph again.  She turned to Harry.  "She left here and was hit by a moving automobile a few blocks away."

"By accident?" Harry asked, horrified.

Velsa cocked her head and stared at Harry.  "That is a peculiar question, Magician."

Doyle was studying the projected photograph.  "Sniper or sharp shooter insignia.  Hmmm, he would have been kept too far from the lines to get that broken nose and broke jaw in hand-to-hand engagements."

He turned back to Velsa.  "That face.  The man's face in his silhouette.  It looked similar to his features."

"I thought the same," said Velsa.

"Of course you did," said Harry.  "So he killed his father because he beat him as a youth.  Then became a soldier and killed 20 or 30 men before dying.  Are you sure you are not reading a story into a photograph, Doyle?"

Doyle sat back down.  "I have seen more than a few healed jaws and reset noses in my time, Harry."

"I want a completely fresh experiment.  Doyle, let us have your picture taken and analyzed.  Then we will know whether this camera is real or a fraud."

"Are you daft, man!?" Doyle roared.  "Why my soul?  Why not yours?"

"Well, it cannot be Velsa.  She is an admitted charlatan."

"That is true," Velsa said.

"And," Harry continued, "I was not in the War so I will not have the kill marks like you would."

Doyle sat stunned for a moment.  "Kill marks," he said slowly.  "You say that with a significantly cavalier tone, Harry."

Harry leaned forward and put a hand on Doyle's arm.  "Arthur, you know I do not.  Please."

Doyle scowled but did not brush off Harry's hand.  "You understand what you are asking?  For me to literally bare my soul to you."

"If this thing even works," Harry said quickly.  Doyle stared at his friend for a long time.  Finally, he sighed and stood up.

"How do we do this?" he said to Velsa.

Velsa smiled coyly.  "A view to the soul of Arthur Doyle.  How delicious.  How very, very delicious this day has begun."
