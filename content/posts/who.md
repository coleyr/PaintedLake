Ellory strolled up the ramp between school buildings, school had let out an hour ago and she was staying behind to help Tiny Allison with Science. TA was giggling the whole time and didn't seem to be remembering anything Ellory told her. Four times she repeated "Initiation, elongation, termination." Allison would look up towards the ceiling exclaiming "I don't get it!" What's to get? Just remember those words in that order. Uhhh. Eventually the two started talking about boys.

"So, if you could 'initiate' with anyone who would it be?" Tiny Allison made a tiny thrusting motion.

"Well everyone knows Mr. A is hot so, yeah. And I used to like David but he is all cool kids and self obsessed now." What about you?

"I would give my left little toe to go out with Jay. He is the right kind of weird. And we both love theater we could open our own one day! Plus he would totally gets me drama wise, ya know we would be like so intense. I would dress him as Mr. Darcy and I could dress as the nude housekeeper" Allison licked her tiny lips. Ellory snorted with laughter.

"Gosh, leave something to the imagination my lady." Ellory bowed slightly.

Allison laughed then bit down on her tiny lip and rocked her shoulders excitedly. The two locked eyes and got quiet. "What?" Ellory said.

"I know someone who likes you? He is cute and caring and in theater! And I think you like him too." Allison looked intently at Ellory with her tiny gaze waiting for a guess.

Ellory looked down at her shoe, her big brown eyes sheepishly considering.

"Michael?" Ellory said almost inaudibly.

"Wait, you like Michael?" Allison said a tiny bit deflated.

"Uhm, I don't know, no. I was just guessing. Who then?"

"Ok, well it is a little less exciting now not going to lie, I thought you would guess, I would say yes and ya know. Any way it's Zeb." Allison said going from bubbles and giggles to answering a math question after the bell has rung.

"Oh" Ellory said.

"Oh!?" Allison repeated but tiny.

"I thought he liked Kelly, then I thought he was on the whole relationships only take away from inner chakra thing. Then he swore off high school girls because they were too immature. Then he said the best girlfriend is a digital one. Then he was in a relationship with that profile that we later worked out he made. Then he was gay for like a week. Then he ..."

"Ellory stop, yes, yikes" Allison giggled "I had forgotten about the Fillary the Finnish exchange student." Allison slapped her small(tiny) knee "But stop, yes. Zeb has had a ... complex series of relationships. Well, not relationships. He has had a complex love life. But you two are close right?"

Ellory nodded. "Yeah we are good friends."

"So? What should I tell em?" Allison waited in tiny anticipation like a small used car salesmen closing on a lemon.

Why the hell is Allison in my non existent relationship with Zeb she thought. Ellory popped over frustration, coy reluctance, and finally resignation. For the sake of protecting Zebs pride and not splitting the friend group Ellory decided she would drive the lemon. I may even get some free dinners and movies Ellory rationalized.

"Yes" Ellory said with the tone of air escaping a balloon.

Tiny Allison hopped down from her stool and ran to the door of the science room. She flung the door open and ran down the hall. Ellory packed up her stuff and walked to the hallway. She looked down at her feet. Shit, Allison didn't wanna do tutoring this was all a tiny scheme. Ellory bumped into someone in the hallway.

"Oh sorry!" Ellory said.

It was Michael.

"Hey, sorry I didn't see ya there. What are you doing her so late? " Ellory said excitedly.

Michael wobbled a bit and blinked a few times. Then he extended his hands and touched his fingers to his thumb on each hand. He then looked at his watch, "I got it" He said to himself. The looked up surprised to see Ellory standing there.

"Oh, hey Ellory, I wanted to tell you something. You got a minute?" Michael said. The two were standing in a an empty hallway.

"Uhh.. yeah." Ellory said unsure on whether to remark on his selective attention.

"Ok, so I have been thinking a lot about you and me and how this all ends up. Well I don't mean ends, but you know college and our relationship in college. And well I need your advise. Wanna walk to Sardis Park?"

Ellory would have said yes. But Allison re emerged dragging Zeb by the wrist.

"Say hello to your new boyfriend." She yelled down the hall.

"Oh you two are dating?" Michael said.

"No, well, not no, yes. We are, but..." Ellory trailed off.

"Hiya E." Zeb said pulling his wrist free of Allison and straightening his fedora.

"Hey Zeb" Ellory said smiling, eyes darting back and forth.

Zeb walked up with what looked like a big bear hug. Ellory reached out to hug Zeb, when the two got close Zeb planted a open mouth kiss on Ellory. Allison squeeled with delight. Ellory's eyelids receded into her skull. The kiss dragged on, Ellorys flat palms flailing a bit.

"Aren't they cute?" Allison said to Michael.

He tapped his forehead.

Ellory stepped back and looked Zeb then at Michael.

He was blinking and wobbling again.
