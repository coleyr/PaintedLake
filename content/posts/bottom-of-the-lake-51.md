Doyle shook his head.  "This has to be the most idiotic--"

Harry waved a hand violently, shushing Doyle.  "Quiet!" he hissed.  "Dobbs is in position."

Doyle leaned his head against the alley wall and stared up into the clouds as if for inspiration.  "Crazy," he muttered.

Harry ignored him.  At the entrance to the alley he could see Dobbs talking to a old woman.

"What is he waiting for?" Harry whispered.

"Perhaps he is out of practice," Doyle said.

Harry looked back.  "I thought you said he had done this before."

"I said probably he had done this before," Doyle corrected.

At the entrance, Dobbs casually dropped a white handkerchief at the same time he reach towards the old woman's purse.

"The signal," Harry said.

"Wait!  Harry, not--"  Doyle started.  Harry ignored him, leaping to his feet.  He ran towards Dobbs and the woman.  As he neared the entrance he yelled "Stop, thie--"

Which was when the old woman swung her purse into his face.  "Get back, cretin!" she yelled.

Harry had been traveling so fast that the force of her blow was magnified.  His legs outpaced his head and he fell onto his back, sliding across the sidewalk and partially into the street.

"Mr. 'arry!" Dobbs yelled, concerned.  He reached a hand out to pull Harry back then fell like a sack of bricks as the old woman's purse slammed into the back of his neck.  Unfortunately, he fell onto the already prone Harry who let out an "ooff".

"Wait!" he moaned raising a hand toward to ward off the old woman's next blow.  He was partially successful as she mistook his hand for Dobbs' head and swung wildly at it.  Harry pulled it back just in time then cried out as his elbow slammed into the sidewalk.  The old woman began slamming her purse into Dobbs' exposed back.  The big man howled in pain.

"What is going on here!" a voice yelled.  It was Doyle.  He had run out of the backside of the alleyway and around the block to look like he was approaching from a different direction.

"Purse thieves!" the old woman shrieked.  She raised her purse for another strike but Doyle caught her hand.

"I will handle this," he said.  He pulled Dobbs up and grabbed him by the lapels.  "You, what are you--"

Then he stopped as Dobbs' eye bulged out.  Doyle looked down to see the old woman's cane which she had just swung with all her might into Dobbs' groin from behind.  He dropped Dobbs' who groaned and cupped his hand around his groin gingerly, but protectively.

"I said--" Doyle started, but had to dodge the wild kick the woman put into Dobbs' side.  She stepped back, panting.  Harry was starting to get up.  The old woman's eyes locked onto him and she started to raise her cane.

Doyle grabbed Harry, pulled him up and punched him in the stomach.  Harry fell to his knees and then onto the ground clutching his stomach.

"Run," Doyle said to the woman.  "I will hold these men until the constables arrive."  The old woman nodded graciously then wacked Dobbs on the way with her cane by for good measure.

Doyle watched until she had turned the corner.  He turned back to Dobbs and Harry who were starting to climb to their feet.

"You," Harry said then wheezed, "punched me, Arthur!"

"Yes," Doyle smirked.  "I had to make it look believable or else she would still be here pummeling the two of you."

"Caught me off guard," Dobbs muttered.  He spat out something that looked suspiciously like a tooth to Harry.

"Come on, gents, enough good deeds for one night," Doyle said.  He muttered something under his breath then said, "We need to get 'Harry the Hero' out of here before she brings down the entire constabulary."
