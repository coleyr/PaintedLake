The café was well lit and it hurt Rose's eyes coming from the dim lighting in the bar next door.  Abelardo went to get some of the strong coffees he and the other rollers favored.  "Liquid life" he called it because it gave a man new reserves of energy.  It had become a joke between the strippers and rollers: "If you take him home get some 'liquid life' on the way, he's almost done".

For the most part, the women never took home or went home with the men.  Neva sometimes did but not often.  Instead the men and women danced slow and sensual in the near dark of the bars.  Dances they had brought from their homelands. The first time Rose had danced with a man it felt almost predatory with her as the prey.  They traveled the floor, weaving through other couples, his eyes stared into hers as he led her body with his. When the dance was over he moved on and she went to sit down since her legs strangely were weak. The older women snickered and made little bawdy jokes. Rose left early, the strange flush staying with her all the way back to the flat she shared with four other women from the factory.

Rose loved the dancing.  It was a way to get close to Abelardo, to touch her face to his, feel his rough, tobacco-stained hands on the small of her back.  He smelled of the factory. Everyone smelled of the factory, but on him it was exhilarating.

"You have a dance for Zacharias now?" asked a man's voice to her left.

Rose looked up. Zacharias moved like a cat to stand beside her. He was lithe but his forearms were muscled. A strong chin.

She gave him a small forced smile. "No more dancing for me tonight." Zacharias was a terrible flirt. He danced with all of the older women.

"We dance," he protested, smiling wryly.

Rose frowned.  The upcoming conversation with Abelardo was gnawing at her insides.  This was not helping.

"Your other dance partners are in there." She nodded her head towards to club next door.

He smiled. "What? Those old women? Never again. Only the spring chickens from now on. If I go home with them we play cards all night."

"Hopefully you play better than you dance," Rose said.  She had meant it to me cruel.

"You wound me," he said.  He placed a hand over his heart.  "I try the old hens again." Rose watched his glide away.

It still stung that he found every woman more attractive than herself. When everyone went to the bar he danced with every woman except Neva and Rose. Even the old Jamaican woman!

Rose had mentioned it once to Neva as they were walking home after a double shift.

"Do you think I am ugly, Neva?" Rose had asked.

"You aren't my type if that's what you're asking after," Neva had quipped back immediately, smirking. Rose envied her her quick wit.

Rose had, of course, blushed, she always blushed, and could not speak for a moment before finally being able to get back to Zacharias.

"I mean to say why does Zacharias dance with everyone but me and you?"

Neva had laughed out loud. "Do you want him to dance with you?"

"No, but I want him to want to dance with me," Rose said. Around them the street flowed with people and noise. Ybor City was a boom town and it brought people from all over the Caribbean and southern United States to Tampa to work or sell things to those workers. Sometimes random snippets of other people's conversation would drift through hers and Neva's.

"Maybe he doesn't like Southern Belles," Neva had said and did a short curtesy. A man in a sweat-drenched suit dodged around Neva and cursed at them both.

"I am not a Southern Belle!" Rose had said. "Why would he dance with everyone but us?"

The next time everyone had gone out Neva had danced with Zacharias. She had practically stalked him around the floor, slammed him into her then danced out of his reach with fierce, graceful spins. The older women had loved it and catcalled the dancers from the sidelines. The other men, too, had had fun, offering up good natured jibes whenever Neva out maneuvered him and left him standing alone while she twirled away, her eyes flashing mischievously as she looked back at him.

"Must just be you he finds ugly," Neva had said when she came back to the table. The crestfallen look Rose tried to hide sent the table of women into hysterics. One or two had actually rolled off their chairs and onto the floor.

The old Jamaican woman had cradled Rose's face and said "I wish he find me as ugly as you!"

None of it had been funny in Rose's opinion. The rest of the night the older women had tortured Zacharias, dancing with him and then dragging him back to the women's tables over and over again to force him to pick another dance partner. And the women had been merciless in their dancing, stalking him like Neva had done though few with her same grace and style.

Zacharias had avoided eye contact with Rose the entire night. Even when the women had tried (once literally) to push him at her he had blushed, stammered, and grabbed a different dance partner than Rose.

At the end of the night he had tried to pull her aside, presumably to apologize for being so cruel. Rose knew she was not pretty but for him not even to try to save her pride and dance with her once. It was unbearable. She had dodged past him and flown out the door, not even waiting for the other women to catch up and walk home with her.

The next day his bravado was back. He did not dance with any one the next time everyone went out. Or the time after that. But like a dog he eventually crept back into the circle of women, dancing with them, and of course, ignoring Rose.

"Can you believe he is back at it again, Neva?" Rose said a few days after.  "What is he even doing?  Can he actually like ALL of them?"

Neva had looked at her strangely then laughed and said, "One of the great mysteries of this modern era, Juliette." Abelardo returned with two coffees, breaking Rose out of her reverie.  He watched Zacharias walking off.

"What did he want?" Abelardo asked, placing the coffees down on the table.

"Nothing," Rose said.  She stood and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.  As usual he looked around self consciously to see who was in the café. Men and their pride , she thought with a sigh.

"So," he said, sitting across from her.  "What was so important to pull us from the dancing?"

Rose stared at him, her mind working.  She had rehearsed the speech a number of different ways, trying out different tones.  He would be shocked yet happy, overjoyed.  But now sitting in front of him, his black hair plastered against his skull after the hours of dancing, fear took ahold of her.  She looked down at her coffee.  Then to buy more time she picked it up and took a sip.  Words ranged around her mind, to and fro, never where she could catch them.  Finally, feeling that the silence growing uncomfortable.

She opened her mouth.  "I..." Rose put her cup down hard on the saucer, her hand still holding the small handle.  "I...I hate coffee," she said and leapt to her feet.  Abelardo instinctively tried to rise since she was a lady and she was standing but he banged his thighs on the edge of the table.  He grimaced and sat down hard.  Rose heard him call out her name at the same moment she realized she was outside the café, running down the street.  She was two blocks away before she realized she was still holding the coffee cup.
