Rodney is not someone who holds the door open for people. He does help little old ladies across the street. He spit into Coaches cola every day for a month just to see if he would notice. Someone who is so disagreeable when no discernible wrong has been done, is much more likely to be criminally disagreeable when action is taken against them. When Rodney was forced to clean statues in front of his peers he loudly seethed.

"You are gonna regret this Duck! These dusty old awards your family gave yourself aren't worth the bird crap covering them." Rodney yelled after Conner Matthews skateboarded by holding an L on is forehead with his thumb and forefinger . To you dear reader, who may be unfamiliar with gesture it is a hip way youths let others know they think they are a loser. The "L" made with the fingers stands for loser.

After Rodney's tirade in front of a gathering crowd Principle Duck walked towards Rodney to sternly and quietly reprimand him. "Waddle away Duck!" Rodney shouted holding up the aforementioned gesture of thumb and forefinger. Rodney mother clicked her mouth at him and pointed at him with a cigarette in between her fingers. "That is not the way that Buzz and I raised you!" Ursula said in a well rehearsed and performed single line of highly telling parenting. It is believed by some of the local children that Rodneys real dad is unknown to him and that his mother chose celebrity astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, as a rouse. It is unknown if Rodney is aware Buzz Aldrin is not his real father.

A bright green flash of plastic could be seen sailing through the air. Those that saw it happen said it was like time stood still. Everyone got quiet just in time to hear the impact of toothbrush on statue. Rodney stood frozen watching with everyone else as the impact landed. What harm could a toothbrush do to the statue of Minteenosee? Well I will tell you, it is not about the physical damage but the intent. Everyone in town loves that statue, it is a shining beacon representing our town. Even people who come to visit the town say they are drawn to it. How could some one defile something that means so much to so many? Well he was, in my opinion, just getting started.

After the projectile was recovered and damage assessed Rodney was chewed out in front of the crowd. Lenny the small boy of ill-repute threw at stick at Rodney and no one called him down for it. Mrs. Kerry, the sweet old window who knits scarves for needy people flipped Rodney off while the preacher watched. Rodney's mother shook her head and according to some close by repeated "We didn't raise him like dat."

Rodney looked out onto the disproving onlookers and lifted a resolute finger. "You love that stupid statue so much? What would you losers do if lost your precious Men-tee-noss-y?" He butchered the name of the beloved town statue. He displayed a blatant disregard for a revered piece of community history and culture. And it is my belief he decided in that moment to commit a heinous crime.
