'He wants to fuck me, I am sure of it' says the beautiful waitress.

'How do you know?' I asked, knowing she had fucked him eleven times.

'He asks me to stay behind and regales me with how my bullshit essay was soo impressive. I wrote it hungover and just sort of filled in between my standard opening, transition and closer." She said grabbing a fry off my plate. The bartender looked over and scowled.

'firstly, how do you know your not a genius? We may infer that you could be, you are in law school and a great pianist. Lastly I can conclude you are a genius and that is why your professor was amazed with your paper.' I posited, you always look like you are opening a present when you are being complimented.

'psssh, the thing is I am smart enough to know that you are right, I am above average, but that same smartness makes me aware that the only people who care to comment on it want to bang me.' The waitress says leaning close. The bartender walked up as I stared into your eyes, even if they weren't really your eyes. 'Hey Bridgett, got a minute, I have a quick question for you about table ten.' He would have said, but he didn't say anything. He gazed off looking at the tv. 'Yes, I will take two Heinekens' I say to him, 'It's on the house' he says, or remembers saying.

'your doing your thing aren't you? The hypnosis' she says. Maybe I should have told you what it really is. We could be so close. I make her forget the drinks. She stares off.

'Any way I think I may let Professor compliments get lucky. I have heard his final is a huge pain'.

'Yeah? You don't think it could get complicated?' I ask musingly. Originally I said that it was a bad idea and unethical. She didn't like that and she yelled at me and told me I just needed someone to fuck. This time she pondered, winked and said 'perhaps'.

She suits your directness and at times I can forget she isn't you. It makes me feel guilty and sick, but I like it.

Sometimes I think about leaving her this way, your thoughts nestled in her head. She doesn't really like her boyfriend and she cheats on him with people from dating apps. Maybe Bridgette needs a little time out. I would have to line up a dozen people and pull a lot of memories if I wanted to keep her for a while. There are three different patrons who come in just to see her and her boyfriend and all her coworkers and her ever present and supportive mother. But those are just excuses. The real reason is she isn't you and also she is. I hold all your memories so I can put them into whoever. I can make your Dad Elvis and Mother a kind nun. You will have fond memories of your nun mother gently brushing your hair. But fuck, me and you? We are stuck with what happened. It's sticky, all balled up into a mess I can't untangle or break anything free from. My guess is I can't tell what's your memory or mine. Did you think I was an unattractive nuisance or did I? Maybe both. I always go to pieces around you. That makes the most sense, I can pull and push memories but I can't create. And I can't just take someone else and put you in the same memory. I mean I literally cannot. It's interesting, both the memories and my inability to change them make me feel powerless.
