Here are some basic things I took away plotted about by points for afterschool murder club:

There is a god who makes everyone love the small town.
In the opening of the story the town is empty and no one seems to care.
The god lives in some statue or gravestone and comes out sometimes.
There is a cult, maybe led by the god’s prophet who protect and promote the town
Some sacrifice (milk) is used to satiate the god. Maybe it’s used by the god??? (Mind control/ influence?)
Other small time gods exist and may be seen 
Sarah goes missing, Michelle turns to Rodney and Daniel for help
TJ joins to clear his name
Could be loads of magic, old god type stuff, alters? Human transformations? Plague? 
Sarah could be killed by the god or someone close to him? (or randomly??)
The school’s basketball game is a huge point of pride
Work backwards with the story to layer in some mystery and have callbacks

*Possible timeline for Sarah’s disappearance. 

6:30 Arrives at the Pep Rally to cheer
9:15 Reportedly leaves for Jackie Hughes house, really goes to be with the Teacher Matt.
10:30 Sarah’s mom calls Jackies house to tell Sarah goodnight. Jackie covers for her becuase she knows about her and Mr. M. 
11:00 Mr. Matt calls Jackies house when Sarah doesn’t show- Her father picks up. He waits then hangs up. Mr. Hughes takes note. 
11:30 Matt goes to the school to look for Sarah
6am Bread, gem stone, soil and milk left on the front porch of Sarah’s house. 
11:00am Saturday: Sarahs mom starts calling looking for Sarah. Thirty minutes later she calls the police.
