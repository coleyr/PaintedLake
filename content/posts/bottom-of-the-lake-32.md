"What?" Harry said.  Doyle tensed and instinctively move a half step in between Harry and Velsa.

Velsa laughed richly and pulled a cigarette out of one pocket.  She put the derringer to the cigarette and pulled the trigger.  A tiny flame flare out and lit the tip of the cigarette.

"Cute," Doyle muttered.

"Is that a daguerreotype?" Harry said, moving forward to examine the box.  It was a black and wooden with a handle on it and a shuttered lens made from bronze on the front.

Velsa put a hand on it possessively.  "We call it the Sadness."

Doyle looked at Harry.  "Well?"

"Open it," Harry said sharply.  "Please," he added.  He nerves were frayed but there was no need to discard decorum and basic human gentility.

Velsa ran a finger down the center of the box then pushed a small clasp  with her finger tip.  The box slowly opened itself out.  Harry bent down to inspect the camera.  It was old and worn.  The paint was flecking off the sides Harry could see as he examined it closer.

"There is no manufacturers label," he noted, running a finger along the side.  "Where was this made?"

"This came into my family through my great uncle.  He was a mercenary and brought it back from one of the many wars he stumbled drunkly through," Velsa replied.

"Is that true?" Doyle asked.

"Is anything," Velsa responded.  "Would you like to see how it works, gentlemen?"

"No," said Doyle.

"Yes," said Harry at the same time.

"Are you serious, man!?" Doyle thundered.  "You drag me in here--again--past a row of teeth curtains.  To the spookiest evening--what are we doing here?!"

Harry sat down at the table and faced Velsa.  "Playing the real game."

"Then by all means let us play," Doyle said, gritting his teeth.  He pulled Harry out of the chair roughly and sat down in his place.  "I will play, mystic."

Velsa gave her queer smirk and placed a hand under the table and withdrew a deck of cards.  Harry came to stand beside Doyle's chair as Velsa began shuffling the cards very slowly.  She laid one out.  Shuffle, card, shuffle, card.  After the third shuffle she spread the cards out in front of Doyle.

"One from you as well."

Doyle selected one at random. Velsa pulled the other cards back, placing them under the table.  She turned over the first card.  It was a skeleton with a scythe and a hood.  It was leading a long line of men and women into a field.

"The Reaper has harvested many in your name," she said.  "In war...and one..."  Velsa looked at Doyle uncertainly.

She turned the next card.  It was a soldier sitting against a rock on a battlefield covered in bodies and weapons.  A broken flag stood nearby and a sword was clutched in the soldiers hand.

"The Broken Man," Velsa said.  "He has taken much and lost more."

Velsa pointed towards the last two cards--one she had drawn and the one he had chosen.  "Choose from my story or yours."

Doyle looked at Harry who shrugged.

"A card face down can stay unseen by all," Velsa said.  "But my card turned and seen will be a part of the story of you," Velsa said.  She leaned forward.  "I will be come a part of you.  Choose now, Soldier."

Doyle tapped Velsa's card.  "I know my story.  Let us see yours."
