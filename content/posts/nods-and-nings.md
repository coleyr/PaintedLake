The rock traveled through the air. Michelle watched with a mixture of horror and fascination as it sailed towards the ugly statue in the center of town. The god watched with horror as it came flying toward him.

Crack!

Three things happened at once in slow motion.

First, Michelle and the god both watched as the long protruding nose on the gods statue shifted hard to the left, dangled and this slowly sank to the ground and bounced three times.

Second, Michelle and the god both cursed. Neither heard the other but both would have admired the other's effort. The god had hundreds of years of listening to human cursing to draw from. Michelle had less institutional knowledge but more than made up for it with spot on word choices and creative ways of stringing those words together until the curse became almost a living thing it the target's mind. (Ironically both chose a goat theme for the base structure of their curse.)

Third, both stared stupefied at the broken stone nose on the cobble stones surrounding the statue. The god knew that should never be able to happen. Worship stones were constructed on another plane and only reflections in this world of the humans. It was where a god or goddess could kick their feet up at the end of a century and let fall away the cares of the mundane world. Had the girl kicked the stone through the Wall?

Michelle knew that she was screwed six ways to Sunday. There were very few unwritten rules in the town for juvenile delinquents: Don't set fire to the Christmas floats. Failing to return a library book gave the local librarians carte blanche to beat you down behind the library. Things like that. Those rules had some gray areas. If the Christmas float was from the next town over then people would snicker and look the other way. If the book you had out had some naked pictures in it then the volunteer book shelver, Mrs. Simpkins, would take it off your hands and return it within a few days to the shelves. All you had to do was complain that you had turned it in already and voila! home free.

But unwritten town law was very clear on the statue in the center of town: Off limits! With (maybe) penalty of death and dismemberment. Michelle had never heard of either happening but then how would you? No one ever broke the statue before now!

Michelle dashed forward and snatched up the nose. She scanned the area wildly; trees, buildings, the Canteen. Everything was closed and empty of people. Michelle spit her gum into her hand, pressed it into the back of the nose and shoved it back on the statue's stone visage.

She held it there for a few minutes then held her breath as she removed her hand. The nose stayed though it did droop slightly. Michelle cursed again and scanned her surroundings. After a moment of frantic searching her eyes stopped on a shiny piece of thin metal lying in the grass.

Michelle bent down and snatched it. She worked it slowly into the nasal passage of the stone nose and into the stone head.

The god screeched! The girl was shoving a giant metal rod into his face. Like the rock she kicked that should not have been able to happen. The god howled louder as Michelle switched to hammering the rod into his statue's nasal cavity with the rock that had broken his nose.

It seemed to take forever and Michelle's arms were tired like she had been swimming through molasses. But it was done. She bent close and inspected her work. Not bad, she thought. No one would see the rod unless the were up close. Michelle considered the way the light reflected off the visible parts of the shinny metal.

As she pondered the problem she popped another stick of gum in her mouth. She chewed then smiled. Michelle took the gum out of her mouth and rolled it around in the dirt. Then she covered the metal with the dirty gum, completely hiding the metal.

Now it will just look like it needs cleaning, Michelle thought.

"Not bad for a night's work, Minty Nose," she chuckled to the statue. "My gift to you, oh great piece of outdated garbage in the middle of my town. Minty smell and a face lift, taboot."

The god seethed as he watched the hateful girl walk away into the night. The pain was gone now. He had heard the click as the rod and gum locked into his essence when the girl unknowingly declared it an offering. It was there in his nostrils now. The smell of mint and a slight trace of canine urine and metal. In his dimension he now had a metal rod, dirt and gum attached to his admittedly already less than attractive visage.

The god cursed again--then he blanched. "I have a follower!" He thought with a sinking feeling. "A foul-mouthed sub-herd human child..." The god blanched even more as the thought finally hit bottom.

"Oh no! I have a priestess!"

This was bad. This was very, very bad. The god sniffed and received an overwhelming smell of mint. He swayed slightly.

"I hate mint," he growled to no one in particular. "And I hate priestesses. Horrid little nings."

And that was when he noticed the overly nasal quality to his voice. "Nings," he said again, trying to force the "th" sound.

"Nis is terrible," he muttered then covered his mouth. The dawn was coming soon. The Wall thickening, pushing him out of the human world--except for a small thread leading back into the mind of Michelle.

"Minty nose," he heard her chuckle. He remembered who he was scheduled to meet with tonight.

"Nuck me!" He muttered.
