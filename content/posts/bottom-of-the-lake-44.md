Click...click...spin...pull Click...click...spin...pull Click...click...spin... Harry pulled open the padlock and set it down in front of him.  There were 27 opened padlocks on the table.  Harry picked up one at random, closed it and inserted a tiny lockpick into the key hole. Click...click...spin...pull Harry tossed the opened lock down and grabbed another one.  It had taken him 4 seconds to open the last lock.  He stared off into the distance as he worked, his eyes unfocused.  The new lock, now closed, made a crunching sound when he twisted his pick.  Harry looked down at the lock curiously then extracted his pick and examined it closely.  It was broken.  He started at it for almost a full minute mapping out where the pick would have broken off and which tumblers could potentially be jammed inside the lock.

His gaze drifted over to the giant diving bell where he performed his underwater escape trick while confined by a straight jacket and locked chains.  He stood up and slowly walked its circumference as he used the broken pick to try to work the now jammed lock.

After some delicate, half noticed coaxing the jammed lock opened.  The broken part of the pick was still wedged inside, but Harry had still been able to work the tumblers.  He returned to the table of locks and shoved them into a velvet bag.  He peered at the jammed lock still in his hand then chucked it into the bag as well.  He immediately closed the bag and shook it, shuffling the contents.

Harry looked around guiltily though there was no one else in his studio.  "It opened once and it can be opened again," he said.   He waited, eyes searching the room.

"There are 26 fully functioning locks in that bag," he said, slightly defensive.  "26.  And I opened that one, too.  You saw it."

He sat down heavily in his chair.  "I am talking to an empty room.  Now, I am talking to myself in an empty room.  Brilliant.  Famed magician found stark raving mad in his home.  Babbling on about a padlock.  Full story in the evening edition."

Harry pulled out a fresh lockpick from the lining of his sleeve.  He opened the bag, selected a lock at random, and drew it out of the bag.  "If you were real," he said to the room, "if you were real..."  He closed the lock, inserted the pick into the keyhole and began working the tumblers.  He cleared his throat.  "You would be ashamed of me right now.  I have made a cock up of everything.  All of it.  Though I should not say that word to you." Click...click...spin...pull The lock opened.  He tossed it on the table and pulled another lock out and started on it.  "Would not say that, I mean." Click...click...spin...pull The lock opened and he placed it down and selected a new one.  It rote to him now after so many years. Click...click...spin...pull. Harry swapped out the lock he was holding for a new one.

"Do you know the first time I ever picked a lock was when I was just a boy?" Click...click...spin...pull. Next lock.  "My mother had a candy jar that she kept in a locked cabinet.  I loved sweets back then." Click...click...spin...pull .  "For no reason other than maybe pure stubbornness, I would try to get those doors open and into that jar." Click...click...spin...pull .  "Then one day I realized I needed a key." Click...click...spin...pull "The next day I realized I could make one with a few of the supplies in my toy box." Click...click...spin...pull .  "It was so...gratifying.  As if I had stolen the Fleece myself." Click...click...spin...pull .  Harry laughed.

His voice sobered.  "Then my mother, your grandmother, found out.  Still not sure how." Click...click...spin...pull .  "It was an unpleasant experience." Click...click... The lock in Harry's hands refused to open.  He pulled out his pick an peered at the lock's keyhole.  He tapped it once, listening, then stood up.  He opened the window and tossed it out.

Harry started back towards his chair then spun around and crept up to the window.  He leaned out and looked down then ducked back inside and crouched down.  He shoved the pick back up his sleeve and shot another glance over the window ledge and down into the street below.

He closed the window and walked over to the door, grabbing his jacket from the coat rack.  "Barking mad," he said, opening the door.  "I will most assuredly make the morning edition."  Harry sighed and walked out, closing the door behind him.
