Two things everyone knows about Rodney, one he is lazy, second he may have been responsible for the biggest string of monument and statue theft in the county. He denies all association with the two week disappearance of six large works of art surrounding townhall. He was never formally interviewed by the police, but deputy Beau Kinkade hinted that Rodney may have been a suspect. Many people are certain of his guilt and I, Jimmy Green, will lay out the case for my Journalism essay in local public interest.

First I will establish that the subject had a clear motive. Let me take you back to just before the homecoming cookout of 1982. Rodney had just become a freshmen at Minteenosee High and already he was causing trouble. He had been sent to the principles office four times for: Sleeping in class, stealing Mrs. Buckets name plate, flinging grapes at Michelle Hutchins and harrassing the PE coach by making lewd noises mimicking farts. Finally, when Rodney was caught with Mrs. Buckets name plate for a second time Principle Duck had enough. He, with consent of his mother sentenced Rodney to the after school detention reparations program. Which is the official name of the program known to the students as TTO, or trash time out. Some students have accused the school of violating child labor laws by forcing minors to clean the school grounds, but it remains a popular punishment for the misbehaving pupils. Rodney hated the assignment mostly because he was placed under coach Alders who shouted blustering orders from a rolling chair on the side walk.

"You can barely stand, how about you roll down here and get some exercise Russ?" Rodney said one Tuesday afternoon to a red faced Coach Alders.

"That's coach Alders to you hooligan!" Alders blubbered. Rodney, according to witness accounts, rolled his eyes set down his bucket of garbage and then punted Coaches 64 oz Champions thermos and then walked off at a slow pace. Coach gave chase but got winded and called after Rodney.

The next day Principle Duck and coach Alders met and devised an appropriate punishment. Cleaning Duck park in front of city hall. They called Rodneys mother to plan. Early morning the day of homecoming Rodney, Coach Alders, Rodneys mother Ursula, and Principle Duck gathered in the park. By all accounts coach and Duck followed Rodney barking orders and nit picking his cleaning performance. Rodney complained loudly.

"Did you bring it ?" Alders asked a large cheeky grin after Rodney had been working for thirty minutes.

"Huh, uh, Yeah" Ursula said between drags of Paul Mall. With that Rodney's mother produced a bright green toothbrush. Principle Duck looked on admiringly as the assorted Duck monuments were cleaned thoroughly by a deeply disgruntled Rodney.

Two girls walked by and one of them, Michelle immediately called put to Rodney.

"Yuck is that your toothbrush dirtbag? You owe that statue an apology!" The story of Rodney cleaning the statues spread. Most students started calling Rodney Michaelangelo. When Lenny Cresner, a small, meek and socially outcast boy started in picking on Rodney, they say, something snapped.
