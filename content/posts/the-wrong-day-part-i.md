Some days , Michelle thought, as the tray of food began to descend, some days it all just goes right .  Thirty seconds before that it had all gone wrong...for Stinky Stacy MacMillan. --------------------------- Like everyone else in the Town with an unwanted moniker, Stinky Stacy had been given hers by Michelle.  It was due to an unfortunate event during a school field trip to the town water factory two years back.

In the interest of safety the girls had been paired up and the boys had been paired up and assigned to a chaperone.  It was a stupid practice Stacy had thought at the time, but according to her teacher experience had proven time and again that boys were stupid and required constant supervision while around heavy machinery.  The boys, of course, complained but Ms. Miss and the factory safety supervisor were refused to hear any dissention.

At the gates the boys stared daggers and grumbled while they were divided up.  Stacy would have preferred to choose her own partner but Ms. Miss was apparently trying to soften the blow for the boys.

"Michelle," Ms. Miss said, reading from her roll list.  She scanned it, looked at the group of girls and scanned it again.  Then scanned it two more times.  "Hmmmm, hmmmm, oh Stacy!  You and Michelle can be safety partners."

All eyes turned to Stacy.  A few of the girls looked at her sadly, but most had looks of guilty and not-so-guilty relief.

"I can partner with Michelle," Sarah said sweetly.  Stacy's heart leapt but sank again as Ms. Miss shot it down.

"Oh, that is sooooo sweet, Sarah," Ms. Miss said smiling broadly.  "You are just so sweet.  But Stacy is happy to do it this time."

"Do it?" Michelle said.  She dropped her voice into a perfect imitation of Ms. Miss's whispy voice.  "Why, Miriam, what scandalous talk."

Everyone paused to see how Ms. Miriam Miss would react.  She ignored Michelle and turned back to Sarah.  "It's fine, Sarah.  Thank you for offering."  She turned back to Stacy.  "You and Michelle are safety buddies."

Michelle grabbed Stacy and pulled her over to where Sarah and her assigned partner, Beatrice, were standing.  Sarah beamed benevolently and with practiced patience while Beatrice went through a nonstop monologue covering everything from her breakfast to what dress she wanted to wear to church this Sunday.  Every few sentences were punctuated with "What do you think, Sarah?"

Michelle pulled Stacy over right as Sarah was interjecting a "I don't know, Beatrice , what do you think should be your favorite flower?"

"Can it, Beatrice ," Michelle said, edging between the two girls. Beatrice immediately fell silent.  She had yet to receive a "Michelle name" but only because she normally flew under the radar.  But being around Sarah tended to pry a person's tongue loose.

"Can you believe that?" Michelle muttered.

"I am sure it was not a slight, Michelle," Sarah said.

"You can it, too, Goldilocks.  Ms. Miss has hated me ever since she found out my mother said 'Ms. Miss will lay down for any guy on the off-chance he might be willing to get her out of that last stupid name'."

"How did she find that out?" Beatrice said then put a hand over her rebel mouth.  Luckily, Michelle had her laser beam boring into their teacher's back.  Ms. Miss stopped partnering and turned her head to look at the four girls.  Her eyes locked on Michelle and the two stared coldly at each other until eventually Michelle smiled and looked away.

"What?" Michelle said. Beatrice looked at Stacy and Sarah uncertainly then after a nod from Sarah continued.  "How did Ms. Miss find out your mom--"

"Because," Michelle said.  "I told her 'My mom says you will l ay down for any guy on the off-chance he might be willing to get you out of that last stupid name'." Stacy's mouth dropped open.

"Michelle, that is a horrible thing to say," Sarah scolded.  "Ms. Miss is so nice."

Michelle shrugged again.  "I was just relaying a message.  It was during a parent-teacher conference so it isn't like I did it behind anyone's back."  She turned to Stacy.  "You had better shut that before you get any flies in there."

Michelle's face had taken on that look it got when she was thinking through horrible names to give someone.  It was like looking into the dead eyes of a shark while it flipped through a cookbook looking for just the right recipe to eat you with.  Stacy's jaw slammed hard so hard that it clicked.

"Come on! The line is moving," Sarah said, breaking Michelle's concentration.

"What?" Michelle said.

"Line, silly," Sarah called.  She was already tugging Beatrice forward.  Kids and even a few chaperones parted to let them through.

Michelle rolled her eyes.  "Come on, Stace," she said, grabbing Stacy's arm.  "Let's see who can stay awake the longest." Did Michelle just call me "Stace"? Stacy thought with a burgeoning sense of hope.  Michelle called only one person by an abbreviated name (and even that was infrequent): Sarah or "Ra".

The rest of the way to the front of the line Stacy practically skipped.
