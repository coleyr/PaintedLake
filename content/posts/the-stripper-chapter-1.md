Rose flexed her fingers and groaned inwardly.  They had long since become callused and strong from her time stripping the stems and other non-essential material from the tobacco used to make the cigars.  Still the work was hard and no amount of time spent at the stripping tables seemed to make it any easier.

The other women along the line were mostly Cuban, though there was a smattering of others like her friend Neva who was American like her.  A few Puerto Ricans had staked a claim at one of the far ends–prime real estate at a table where the women sat packed in like sardines, shoulder to shoulder.  The Puerto Ricans took turns swapping out the end-of-the-bench spot, a brief respite from the press of bodies.

The men had more room at their tables where they rolled the cigars.  That apparently was more of an art than stripping and therefore needed a luxurious, full inch of space between each man.  It seemed odd to Rose that the men had the extra space when their arm movements were forward and back mostly.  The women spent a lot of time making lateral movements as they pulled and tugged at stems creating a dance of politeness, irritation and usually bruising up and down the line.

That is how Rose’s brain worked though, always dissecting everything looking for a better way to do it.  For example, the women’s table was all the way at the front while the tobacco was all the way at the back of the cigar rolling factory.  The women had to waste precious working time walking down row after row of tables of the cigar rollers.  That was inefficient when you were paid by the ounce of quality tobacco you made.

When she said as much to Neva the other woman had laughed with that deep baritone, throaty laugh she had.  A laugh that felt warm and strong and for some strange reason Rose couldn’t put her finger on, slightly rebellious.

“We’re in the front so the men can look at our asses when we stand up.  The rest get to see our full, luscious breast bouncing as we walk.  Didn’t you ever wonder why the top producing rollers get the front and back rows?”  Neva laughed again.  “Ass-men in the front, breast-men in the back.”

“Who gets the middle?” Rose had asked.

Neva had only winked and gone back to her work.  It took her a moment but then Rose had blushed furiously as she understood the joke.  Up and down the table the other women had laughed good naturedly at her.  A few making remarks Rose would have been heavily disciplined for in…  But the past was better left to die alone behind you.  That was another of Neva’s sayings.

Though she was only two years older Neva seemed ancient with knowledge, her eyes weary but defiant. I wish I could be unbreakable like her, Rose had thought on more than one occasion.

The other end of the table was always reserved for an older Jamaican woman.  Her skin was so dark that it seemed to gleam.  Rose had wondered how the woman could hold such a choice spot until she saw Neva defending it three or four times out behind the factory on a smoke break.  Neva was fierce.  Once she had won a fight without throwing a single punch.  She just stood in front of her opponent, a much larger woman, taking her blows and kicks, never flinching, a look of quiet cold rage growing in her eyes.  When Neva had eventually raised a single fist the other woman had backed away immediately, hands up in supplication, her confidence broken.  The other woman had been much larger than Neva but something in the fiery, young woman’s posture spoke of well of bottle rage waiting to come forth.  That woman had been new.

Two weeks later, passing down the line of tables Neva had stopped in front of the woman, blocking her path.  The room had grown silent.  Neva raised her fists slowly, giving the other woman time to strike first.  It had been a quick, but brutal fight.  Neva at one point sitting on top of the crying woman, smashing her fists over and over again into her half covered face.  Neva had not been looking down, she had stared out across the room, making eye contact with each man, hatred burning.  When Neva stood up she stared into the face of each man, challenging them silently as she wiped the blood from her hands onto her apron.

Most of the men looked away, some stared back with unconcealed hatred, but a few, a very few smirked a challenge back at her.  Those were the ones she danced with at night in the cafes and bars when the women collectively went out with the men for an after work drink.  A few had come in over time with a black eye or a scratched up face, but they had never seemed upset at their injuries.  Rose wondered what had made Neva into the wild thing of beauty, laughter, and fury that she was.

Everyone came with secrets and Rose had recently gotten one of her own: inside her a tiny life was growing now.  It had come on suddenly, the sickness in the morning and sometimes after lunch.  The continuously near-ravenous hunger was almost maddening.  She had not told Abelardo but soon the women of the table would figure it out and it would pass quickly to the men.  In a factory gossip traveled like wild fire.  If she was going to be the first to tell him she would need to do it soon.  But there was something…something…she could not describe it, but there was something to being the only one that knew about the child inside her womb.  Something to being the only one that knew his (yes, she knew it was a he) that knew his name.  It was comforting and terrifying and…all hers.  Only hers.

The nausea hit her suddenly then and she hunched forward.  The other women noticed.  A few of the older ones’ gazes lingered. I need to tell him very, very soon , Rose thought.  She wondered how she would sit at the table once her stomach was protruding so large that her arms would not reach.  Again, an inefficiency.  The rollers’ benches moved and so could be pushed back, the strippers bench was bolted to the floor.  No one knew why.

Neva looked down at her timepiece she kept in her pocket.  She cursed colorfully.

“That bastard moved the time back again.  Five full minutes.  He is getting bold,” she said.  Sometime the foreman would adjust the clock back to get a few more minutes work out of everyone.  It seemed–again–inefficient since rollers were paid by the pound and strippers by the ounce, not based on any length of time spent working.  But like the bolted bench it made no sense and no one who noticed ever said anything to the foreman.  Not even Neva. Today at lunch, Rose thought. Or…maybe tonight at the bar.  But I will tell Abelardo today.  Be unbreakable.  Today or tomorrow at the latest!
