Calowyn relaxed into the plush seat of the car as it backed out of the death scene and headed up the road.  Within a few seconds the vid blinked an incoming call.  Calowyn waved it through.

"Calowyn," Dal, her supervisor said, as a greeting.  He was working as he spoke and did not look up.

"Dal."

"Are you alone?" he asked.  He knew she was. Jakub's personal trackers and individual equipment trackers would show him still at the scene, processing it with the techs.  But the old protocols died hard.

She nodded.  Had she said 'yes' he would have assumed she was not but under duress or for some reason wanted to spread misinformation.  They did that sometimes with the media--intentionally killed a story by letting things "slip".

"You cut Jakub loose?" Dal asked.  "Permanently?"

"Yes," Calowyn said.

"How did he do?"

"Excellent," Calowyn replied.  She stared at the scenery as the car passed it:  buildings, people going about their business, a few stray dogs scrounging for scraps.  "He's ready.  I pushed him down to Tech level but I would recommend pulling him back with a 'Calowyn made a serious judgement error' in a month, maybe two."

On screen, Dal looked up from from his monitor and over at the vid's camera.  He raised an eyebrow.  "Two months?  Interesting.  That may be a record."  Dal flipped through something on his monitor.  "83 days," he said.  It was her record.  "That would give Jakub a pretty big head when he finds out.  Assuming he ever clears up that far."

"He will," Calowyn said.  "Make it 100 days then.  I only busted him down to Tech.  Good kid."

"Great," Dal said absently, returning his attention to his monitor.  He had already dismissed the Jakub from his mind.  "Sending you a clean that came in yesterday.  Tech is tied up--probably at your scene you just left actually--so you will have to babysit the body for a while."

Calowyn scowled and wrinkled her nose.  "Yesterday?  It is going to be good and ripe by now."

Dal smirked.  "No rest for the wicked or the weary."  He cut the connection.

The car had come to a stop to make a turn.  On the street corner a woman was selling oranges in giant bags.  At few even even looked edible, only slightly rotten.  Calowyn rolled down the window and the woman hobbled over, favoring her right leg.

"You want," the woman said.  It was a question and a statement.  Calowyn reach out and held up her palm.  The woman did the same, completing the cash transfer.  The car opened its de-com port and the woman placed the oranges in it and walked away to get another bag to sell.  As the car turned, the de-com port closed and whirred, scanning and killing any parasites, viruses or other nasties that might have tried to hitchhike along for the ride.  The car sped up to match the surround flow of traffic and merged lanes.

Calowyn pulled up the address and stats on her case.  "You can control three things," Dal had told her after she had suffered through her 83 days of exile to lowest level of the department.  "Your preparation, your effort, and your attitude."  Having been unexpectedly raised back up to the team Calowyn had gushed and swore to uphold those tenants.  She had been always successful on the first two and mostly successful on the third.  Though maybe less successful lately. I need a vacation, she thought.

She pulled up the case and skimmed through it.  The (hopefully) recently dead man was middle aged, no significant health issues, no sketchy political affiliations.  A model citizen.  Maybe an accident or just bad luck.  The address was in one of the suburbs, home prices in the area reasonable, buy-to-sell ratio stable.  Crime statistics at tolerable levels.  And so on.  Calowyn pulled up his social medium and other public photos and flipped through them.  He was in good shape, probably a college or high school athlete, active, a lot of foreign trips to exotic beaches it looked like.  He had kind eyes.  Calowyn liked that.  There was--

Calowyn stopped flipping through the images.  She flipped back until she found the one she was looking for.  It was an unmasked one, the man was with who she assumed to be family and/or close friends from his Pod.  She zoomed in on his face and took it to 3D.  Calowyn reached out and slowly rotated the virtual representation of the man's head and face from left to right.  She recognized the face.  Not the man's face specifically, but some of the features.

She called Dal.  "The case.  He is related to the Pre- at the scene I just left?"

Dal looked over immediately.  "Your scene was a Pre-Pandemic?"

"Are the two related?" Calowyn asked again.  Dal stared at her for a moment, seemingly dumbfounded.  Then he turned quickly back to his monitor and touched it a few times.  "I do not know, Cal."  He sucked at his teeth as he worked.  "Your scene's vic has not loaded yet.  Techs must be still processing."

"Seems a little too coincidental if they are related," Calowyn said with a sinking feeling.

Dal nodded.  "It does."  He turned back to the vid screen.  "You want me to give it to someone else?"

Calowyn nodded.  Dal touched his monitor.  Then touched it again.  He leaned forward and read something on the screen then sat back.  "Well," was all he said.

"Well?" Calowyn prompted.

"Supervisor override is disabled.  Someone either wants you specifically on this or at least--assuming, yes the scene got loaded by Tech just now and the two cases linked immediately.  They want you or at least the same investigator,."  Dal said.  He touched his screen, typing.  "It...it may not be specific to you..."  He smiled.  "Ah, yes, you are in the clear, Cal.  I can swap you out but you need to file a statement on the scene case for the replacement investigator."

Calowyn nodded immediately.  She was relieved that she had not been stuck on this one specifically, only through bad luck in the rotation.  "Kill it," she said.  She yawned.  "I need a drink."

"Hmmmm, interesting," Dal said, reading his screen.  "You are not unlinked from Jakub yet.  That is why you jumped in the rotation.  Someone wants him on both cases."  Dal smiled wickedly.  "At Full Investigator no less."

Calowyn practically squawked.  "Full--"

Dal's smile shifted to a smirk.  "One day.  Actually, barely an hour.  That kills your 83 days to Full Investigator with room to spare."  Dal was enjoying this immensely.  "Sorry, Callie.  You just lost the record."

"That--that--" Calowyn could not believe her ears.  Professional pride aside (well, mostly aside) it was...odd.

"Leave my name on it," she said suddenly.

"What?" Dal asked.  "You want--"

"Leave me on.  As Head Investigator."

Dal stared at her dumbfounded.  "Are you sure?"

"Send the address to me," Calowyn said then disconnected.
