"I couldn't let my favorite sister get married without me saying a few words," Sam said.  She waited but no one laughed.  A bead of sweat trickled down the side of her face joining the other 500 that had already made that trip to the scratchy collar of her dress.  That had been her one and only joke and it had flopped.  Even Katelyn looked unimpressed and it was their inside joke!

Sam looked down.  The baby's incessant kicking had stopped.  For one horrible panicky moment she wondered if the heat--but, no, when she put her hand to her stomach she could feel his heart beat strong and true as always.  No feeling of wrongness .  Still she thought What am I doing here?  I don't even like half of these people. That was not kind.  Sam centered herself, looked down at her speech notes and opened her mouth, but nothing came out.

"Today!" someone yelled.  Sam really hated what alcohol did to some people.

Why was she here? To support your sister who loves you .  That was her mother's voice.  Sam knew it well.  It sounded like her own voice.  But as she looked helplessly around the room she realized she could not make her voice come.

Don stood up to retrieve the microphone.  "Baby brain," he said to the crowd by way of explanation. That got them going.  Everyone was laughing now.  Sam blushed.

No, no, not everyone.  Sam's eyes met Ms. Flanigann's, but they did not seem vacant and vapid now.  They were sharp and intelligent, piercing.  The ancient woman did not smile now.  Instead she leaned back in her chair, watching.  Sam heard the last words Ms. Flanigann had said to her in her head again.  She snickered the way a child caught doing something wrong would even though Sam knew that language was not lady-like language.  She turned away to collect herself and found Katelyn staring at her.  Sam gave her a weak, apologetic smile.

"Sorry, I screwed up your stupid, hot wedding, Katie-Kate," Sam said.  The room erupted into more laughter.  Sam blanched.  What had she just said?  Katelyn gave her a strained smile.

"I am glad I came," Sam said, recovering.  "It's not often I get to drive 500 miles to pay to drink watered down beer and sweat my ass off."

Katelyn's smile Became even more brittle. Oh God , Sam thought. I am embarrassing her.  The heat.  It is the heat .

Don was standing in front of her, his hand reaching towards the microphone, stupid smile plastered on his face.  Sam took an involuntary step backward.

"Don, you're still vertical!?"  Sam said.  Don's hand stopped in mid-grab as the crowd erupted into laughter again.  He suddenly looked like a deer caught in the headlights.  Don made the jokes--he was not the butt of them.

"Frankly, I thought you'd be tits up in a field pissing yourself by this point."  Sam waived at one of the waiters.  "Get this man a drink!  STAT!!"

Don seemed to shrivel in on himself as the laughter rolled around the room like thunder.  A few of the groomsmen fell out of their chairs. Holy Banana Sandwich!  I am funny! Sam thought.  In front of her, Don took an unsteady step back and then walked woodenly to his seat.

"That is the best I'm-Not-Drunk-Walk I've ever seen, Don.  Do you practice that every night on the side of the road?  I bet the blue lights really bring out your complexion," Sam could not stop herself.  She could see out of the corner of her eye that Robbie looked pissed.  He was staring daggers at her. It's not my fault! she wanted to scream to him. I can't stop !

Sam was right.  She really could not stop.  Her eyes searched the room frantically for help as her voice rang out again over the loud speaker. "Someone give Don a hand.  Actually, never mind that.  Somebody get him a liver."

Sam looked from Robbie to Katelyn then to Zach.  Zach was laughing uproariously and for some reason that made her feel better.  If there was one person she could count on it was Zach.  Good old Zach.  She took a relieved breath as he winked at her. Get back on point , Sam ! Sam turned around, looking for Randy.  He was seated with the groomsmen.  "Everyone let's give a big hand for Randy.  That was a great speech.  It is going to be very hard to follow."

Randy nodded graciously.  "Just one question, though," Sam continued.  "Actually for all the groomsmen.  You know you're not black, right?"

Randy and the groomsmen smiled self-consciously.  Sam turned and gestured at the bridesmaids' table.  "I guess they'll all know it, too, by tomorrow."

Laughter, a few catcalls from around the room.  "I'm not picky send them over here," yelled someone from the divorcee table.

"Great," Sam said back.  "But you should grab Don too before it's only his walk that he can keep straight."

Somehow, Don managed to sink down onto his chair even further.

Sam was actually having fun now.  She waved her arms to quiet the crowd.  "Okay, okay.  That's all the jokes I had written for this.  If anything else is funny you know you're too drunk." More laughter.

Sam faced her sister and waited for the room to quiet down a little.  "My sister.  My sister."  She turned back around to the groomsmen's table.  "When I knew Katelyn she only had one name.  I mean come on, Randy.  That is your best shot at a nick name?  The same name twice?  Where did you even come up with that?"  It was like the laughter was a bubbling liquid that filled the room every time Sam spoke.

"I can think of one for you," Randy said.  That got some confused, good natured laughter.

Sam smiled.  "See and I can't even think of one for you. What about 'dick-face-dick-face." Sam could feel that one went too far for some people--especially her mother. So what? Sam noticed a waitress dropping off a fresh piece of cake at the table to the left. She snatched it off the plate and took a bite. Some of it smeared on her cheeks. Why hadn't she gotten a slice big enough shaped like a giant axe wedge?

"That's a mouthful," Sam said as she chewed. She looked back over at Randy. "Wow, I bet you don't hear that often from a woman." 

"The name," Sam yelled in mock indignation as people laughed.  "The name, people." She pointed around Randy. "I meant 'Double Dick Face'. Actually that kind of rolls off the tongue." Sam's mother practically swooned in her chair. Sam's father gave her a harsh gesture to stop.

Sam ignored them both. "Get your mind out of the gutters, people. Speaking of which has anyone seen Don?" Sam didn't think the laughter in the tent could have louder but it did.

Sam turned back to the wedding party's table.  "Okay, back to the point.  Katie-Kate, has always been there for me."  A few snickers.  A couple of people smirked at Randy.  The room quieted down slightly, feeling the mood shift to something more sedate and personal.

"When I got pregnant I was scared.  I bought 77 books on pregnancy. 77.  Can you believe that?"  Sam began walking around the room, making eye contact here and there like she had done this a million times. "I bet I've thought more about pregnancy than anyone in this room...except maybe the bridesmaids after they wake up tomorrow morning."

Laughter again.  A table of unhappy bridesmaids, knives behind those eyes and smiles. I am going to be killed by gang of girls in pink taffeta tomorrow , Sam thought.  "I am going to be to be killed by gang of girls in pink taffeta tomorrow," Sam said, echoing her own thoughts before she could stop.

She put her hand to her mouth like she was talking into a radio.  "All units, be on the lookout for a gang of slightly drunk bridesmaids in gaudy pink taffeta."

Sam turned back to Katelyn. "Seriously Kate, did you really think dressing them like that would distract people from the fact that you of all people chose to wear white today? That's like me wearing a bikini right now." Sam made air quotes. "Let's all pretend we're still virgins.'"

Sam turned to the "kid's" table. They were wide mouthed with half-shock, half-amusement. "White means you're still a virgin. Sort of like most of the groomsmen right now. Save your money, guys, so you can get out your parents basement some day."

That got a few laughs, but not many.  Mostly uncomfortable ones. It was hard to come back from virgin jokes at the bride's expense. "So, all joking aside, Kate has always been there for me.  I have always," Sam looked around the crowd of faces seriously, "always been able to count on Kate being behind me in whatever I do."

Sam's parent's nodded though her dad still looked a little uncomfortable. I am never going to hear the end of it on that virgin joke , Sam thought.  Not that she could blame him.  Katelyn had never been shy around the boys.  Sam could count on 2 fingers the number of men she had been with.  Katelyn would need both her hands and feet and to borrow the hands of half the groomsmen--maybe she already had. Shoot that would have been a good one ! Too late. Sam gave her dad a small smile. Dad is probably is just glad she managed to get married before --

"My dad is just glad--" Sam slammed her mouth shut so hard it jarred her teeth a little.  "My dad is just glad he can finally have a bathroom of his own again." Polite laughter. The jokes were supposed to be over, the audience was a little punch drunk now. Funny or sentimental. Which way was this going. Sam had no clue either. It is like I have no filter , Sam thought.  "So anyways Katelyn has always been right there behind me.  When I graduated from college I went to work at a bank.  When Kate graduated a few years later she discovered there were things called 'banks'."  Sam winked at the room.  "She discovered overdraft."  Laughter and a few appreciative groans. Going to be jokes again. Maybe Sam would finish sentimental they were thinking. She could read it in their faces.

"So anyways I bought 77 books and there was Kate right behind me buying her one pregnancy book to support me. We--"  Sam's eyes met Katelyn's. Katelyn quickly looked away.

"Perfect day..." Sam said to herself.  People in the crowd exchanged glances. God chose this day , Sam thought.  Or had she said it aloud. Katelyn shifted uncomfortably in her chair.  Beside her Robbie sensed the abrupt change in Katelyn's mood from anger to discomfort. He put his hand over hers. At any other time it would have been a warning to Sam but...

Sam. Was. Furious.  The level of anger washing over her she had never felt before.  It was almost hatred.  It came from deep, deep inside her. It was not coming from her baby. It was coming from the her around him. The part of her that did not care about family politics or decorum. The part that was tasked with bringing this baby into the world, health and happy--regardless of who she had to piss off to do it. Fuck you, Katie-Kate. Sam had seen a movie once where a bunch of hairy smelly bikers had accidentally wandered into a bar run by the mafia. They had been all bravado and jokes until the scary mafia boss locked the door and said "Now, yous can't leave." All the air had left the room,"the narrator had said . "These were guys who had a reputation for breaking up bars. But they knew they had wandered into the wrong bar. " And then the ass-kicking had started.

That was the feeling in the tent now. The door was locked in the sweltering tent with no walls. No one was getting out of here unscarred.

Because it was...so damn irresponsible of Katelyn.  Thoughts half-formed slammed into Sam's brain all at once. You risked...to cover up...you hid me in the back of the tent to...no one could see us together...you lied... Sam made her decision.  She had Zach.  She had her son.  They were a family. Screw the rest of these selfish drunk bastards. "Yes, Katie-Kate has always been there behind me.  Zach and I got pregnant about 7 months ago.  I say 'about' because there was a month there where Zach swore we couldn't trust the pregnancy tests and he wanted to keep trying.  I had to start sleeping standing up to keep him off me."

The crowd laughed again, glad to be back in familiar territory.  "And again there was Katie-Kate right behind me."  Sam turned back to Katelyn.  "How far along are you now, Katelyn?"  Katelyn should have known the words were coming. Sam could see the terror and also defiance in her eyes. She knows I know. Maybe she thought prim-and-proper Sam would not have the guts to say the words--but Katie-Kate was wrong. I have guts in spades right now , Kate , Sam thought, then laughed at her own pun. It was a high pitched sound, a little crazy.

The room went dead silent.  Even the wait staff froze in place.  "The heat was dangerous to my baby.  You knew that," Sam said, all pretense of humor dropped.  "You knew it, Kate.  And you could not be what everyone always said you would be--waddling down the aisle 6 months pregnant, not able to fit into your perfect lying white dress.  We could not have that, now could we, Kate."  Sam could hear people shifting uncomfortably in their seats behind her. She pressed on.

"You risked my..." Sam trailed off as the realization of the entire level of Katelyn's selfishness hit her.  "Holy Fuck, Katelyn!  The heat would not just--not just my...Holy Fuck, Kate!  You fucking selfish bitch!"

Sam needed to be away from the heat and away from Katelyn and away from Don and every other fucking person at-- Enough! Sam looked at Zach. It was time to go.  "Zach, come on!  Let's..." 

Sam saw the look on his face. He was looking at Katelyn. Suddenly, the last piece that had been niggling at her consciousness fell into place as her brain did the math. Robbie came onto the scene just slightly too late to be the father of Katelyn's baby.

"Zach," she whispered.  He did not even have the courage to look her in the eyes. All those trips here. You already HAVE a family !

"Had a family," Sam finished aloud. She walked slowly over to the table to pick up her purse.  Her eyes were on her on the back of the tent but she could feel every eye in the room on her.  At the back table, Ms. Flannigan was still there but the vacant, vapid look was back.

"Lovely," was all she said.  Sam picked up her purse, started to shove the speech notes into it then stopped.  She tossed the notes on the table.

"The perfect day, Katelyn," Sam said without turning around.  "God picked the day, Robbie?" she said acidly. When Sam turned around Katelyn was staring at her hands, crying.  The wedding party was over.  People were quietly gathering their things.

Sam left the wedding hall, deciding to find the first hotel outside of city limits that had a clean pool and some real air conditioning.  She put a hand on her stomach as she walked.  The baby kicked but only slightly.

"I know," Sam said to him. "I'm hot, too."

 

Ms. Flannigan waited until the tent had cleared it and it was just wait staff working quietly in the background.  The old crone stood very carefully and reached carefully for her cane.

"And they say gods have no sense of humor," she said to no one in particular.
