The room was silent as the Admiral entered. He was in excellent shape, only a bit of gray shading his temples. He still looked like he could jump out of a plane into a hot LZ even though his active Special Forces days were more than two decades behind him.

He was a commanding figure, his presence like a force of nature sweeping into the room, so silence at his entrance was not uncommon. Today, though, it was for entirely different reasons.

He set a folder down at the third seat from the head of the table and sat. Calowin smiled slightly from her place at one of the side chairs along the wall. The junior officers station--where she like her fellow seat mates could be ready with a fact or figure for the senior officer or government official they supported.

That was the Admiral's way. He took a lesser position at the table to indicate free discussion was open and welcome and expected. Few quiet personalities survived his conference room for long.

"Folks," he said without preamble, "they knew we were coming. We lost a team and I want to know why."

Calowin's boss cleared his throat. "We own some of that."

That, she knew, was a little politicking. Better to be the first one out of the gate and own your piece.

The Admiral nodded for her boss to continue.

"We got duped. They knew we were listening. Obviously. But they did an end run around our best and brightest and all of our systems."

The Admiral tapped his fingers, drumming out a staccato beat.

"Sylvia?" He looked over at a matronly woman in glasses. You wouldn't know by looking at her that she wrote the book on system security--the ones secretly published for a select audience--self destruct if lost type of thing.

"We are clean, John. Triple checked. No one got in."

She was the only one who called him by his first name. Contractor, a little quirky. She once scolded the Secretary of the Navy. The Admiral collected odd types--personality was no concern as long as they were the best.

"Sir--" Calowin's boss started.

The admiral waved him to stop. An unusual gesture in this room. "No need to fall on the sword twice, Art." Calowin noted the slight tightening of her boss's shoulders. He was "Arthur".l--not "Art", not "Artie", not "A.P." (The president's nickname for him). Also part of the admiral's style: subtle disapproval.

"Sir, we did our own checks as well. Nothing from outside," Arthur continued refusing to be cowed.

"Ops?" the Admiral said looking to a giant man in a captain's uniform.

The big man chewed his lip for a moment. "Could be we missed something on the way in."

That was about as close to admitting a set back as the admiral was going to get out of him so the admiral sat back and looked around the table.

"Enough navel gazing." He stopped tapping abruptly. "We lost good people out there today. The President is not looking for heads." He did not add the implied "yet". "Ideas?"

The room was silent. They and their teams were the best of the best. If there was something that could have been done better they would have done it.

Calowin realized her foot was nervously twitching enough that her fellow wall hugger to the left was looking at her. Arthur seemed to sense her movement. He sighed.

"There is," he began slowly, "an option we have been looking at." When the admiral did not stop him, Arthur went on reluctantly.

"One of our," Calowin could almost feel Arthur smirk, "best and brightest, believes she can train a machine to recognize...ah...fake code buried in real code."

A few people shot curious glances Calowin's way, wondering if she was the "best and brightest". She blushed slightly and peered down at her notes to hide it.

The admiral was tapping again. In most people it would mean impatience but in him it was more like anticipation. "And...?"

Arthur leaned to one side so that he was no longer blocking the admiral's direct line of sight to Calowin.

"Miss Hayes, would you be so kind?"

Twenty-four pairs of eyes snapped to her face. She saw Silvia cock her head slightly. She stared at Calowin like she would at an interesting but soon to be squashed bug on her windshield. The admiral's tapping stopped.

Calowin hesitated.

"Commander, a lot of Joe's boys are not even going to get the courtesy of a body bag. If you have something that will keep that from happening again I would like to hear it," the admiral said.

"Well, sir, our initial findings indicate we can train some of our more advanced machines to recognize who wrote something and when."

"With how many words?" The admiral asked. He was no code breaker but he knew the basics.

Chairs creaked as a few people leaned in closer. Speak with authority, Calowin thought. "300, sir." Then she added slightly softer. "Give or take."

More chairs squeaked, but this time as people sat back. Her fellow wall-huggers on either side edged away. Calowin knew she was blushing furiously. Fifty words was a luxury in intel gathering and code breaking, twenty was barely workable.

The admiral stared at her then at Arthur, trying to see if there was a game going on he was missing. After a moment he said, "But you are one of Artie's best and brightest so I assume there is more?"

Calowin cleared her throat. "We--well, I, actually, I believe I can get the approximate required word count down much lower."

The admiral stared into her eyes. He did not have kind eyes, but there was a hint of something in them. Amusement? That irritated Calowin. She pushed on somewhat recklessly.

"Under twenty. Maybe under ten."

Arthur visibly stiffened at that. It did not go unnoticed. This was a room of the best but also a room of sharks by nature, hunters. Blood in the water was irresistible.

The admiral waited, maybe to see if Calowin would back down. She did not.

"Twenty," the admiral said.

"Or ten," Sylvia, the head of Cyber Security offered. Sharks.

"Why is this the first time I am hearing of it?" The admiral sat back and steepled his fingers.

Arthur shifted slightly, covering Calowin. The question was for him anyways.

"There were more traditional methods available. And there has been," Arthur paused, choosing his words carefully, "resistance from some sectors that are critical to our work."

The admiral stood. "Which?"

"Tech, high level academia, one or two key individuals," Arthur said.

The admiral gathered his folder. "Sylvia and her team will liaise with the tech sector and clear the way." Sylvia sat up sharply but said nothing. Her fate had just been tied to Arthur's there was nothing for it. Maybe the admiral blamed her somehow.

"You have the full support of the White House on this." The admiral continued. "Today," he added somewhat reluctantly.

He looked at Sylvia. "Ten words."

He turned back to the room. "The rest of you start picking up the pieces while Joe and I go write some letters and make some phone calls." Everyone stood and began filing out.

Calowin, Sylvia, her junior, and Arthur were the last.

"Arthur," Sylvia said curtly. He nodded back.

After they had left Arthur turned to Calowin. "You know the house always wins right, Callie?" He left.
