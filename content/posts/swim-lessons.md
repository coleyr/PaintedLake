The great thing about moving from here to some distinct memory is that there is time to prepare for the experience. Too often thoughts about upcoming events or pending assignments pulled Michaels mind from someplace he wanted to be. As a child Michael looked out his window and saw a flood light illuminate the brilliant underside of a great oak. “There must be a party under there. A flurry of tables and bustling guests silently scuttling about with smiles plastered on their faces and handfuls of treats.” The trouble with seeing parties that aren’t there is that the feeling of some distant happy place erodes the close happy place with longing. Fear of missing out, an oversimplification, but that’s what his friends assured Michael he suffered from. Diagnosis is really only helpful if you don’t like the disease, and Michael found the idea of celebration’s just around the corner cheerful.

The absolute fantasy Michael lived was believing there was a party someplace and then moving to the time when he was right about the party under the lights. Better still he knew the time he was free of unaccounted celebration so his mind could rest where it was. From the ages of six to thirteen every one of Ellory’s birthdays was held at the neighborhood pool. The Eastover pool was built in the sixties and at its deepest was sixteen feet. The surrounding pool deck was so narrow that the lounge chairs sat right up against the edge and patrons danced around them, occasionally falling in. The anchor that could reliably land Michael at Ellory’s party’s was the smell of chlorine mixed with the sound of tinnie radio pop music flung from speakers that looked like sirens. Once Michael found the memories of Ellory’s eighth and ninth birthday so indistinguishable that he found himself at both at once. The only significant deviation was that one year they did cake first and the greased watermelon second and the next they switched. Likely on account of Michael gulping water and feigning eating at the bottom of a too deep pool.

Today he would visit her Eleventh birthday and sit under the shade of the diving board. He lay down and imagined the warm pool deck and the acrid smell of the cleaning solution used in the bathroom along with some kid’s version of “doo op” and he opened his eyes. The world was jumbled and he was worried he was two places at once again but after a moment he felt the goggles around his eyes and emptied them of water. “Wanna race?” Ellory said, peering up underneath him. Michael didn’t often like to do too much until he could feel all of the things he ought to feel like pain, hunger and water in his ears. “Sure” he coughed and squeaked.

Ellory went around to her friends and cousins and did her best to recruit swimmers for her event. The cousins, who were all older, declined in the sort of tone that said they had better things to do. Jessica, who took most of her life lessons from Barbie vhs tapes was pretty sure Barbie had never swam in a race and best to avoid it just in case it was something Barbie wouldn’t do. Jake agreed but only after splashing Ellory four times in the eyes. Jamie said yes only because she said yes to everything and was so shy it was unclear if she had any opinions at all.

“You ready?” Ellory said, looking at the squad holding on the edge at the five foot swim area. Moving from one side to another swimming from here to there. Michael flopped instead of swam, Jake tried just walking fast but could barely touch. Jamie swam silently and swiftly in what appeared to be some existence from the otherwise absent individual.

“You coming?” Ellory bragged a body length in front of Michael.

“You better watch out, I am gonna beat you!” Michael retorted, slapping the water harder without moving forward very much at all. Jamie won by a long stretch but slunk off so it was like Ellory won.

“How’d you get so fast?” Michael asked bobbing up and down reaching for the wall.

“I don’t know” Ellory said sheepishly. She smiled and blew bubbles.

Michael smiled, holding to the cement ledge. “I am glad you invited me to your birthday”.

“I am glad you could come, my cousins have to come you know. My mom makes them. And Jamie just comes to my parties because I ask her. Jake is mean.” Ellory trailed off looking around the pool at other guests. “I am
