They are on to me. Over the past two days I developed a super computer that is capable of opening a door to other dimensions. You must find it, but for reasons I hope are clear I couldn’t just tell you where it is. I have hidden it and gone into hiding. They are following me, and I can’t go after it now. It’s up to you. Don’t fail and don’t get caught!
