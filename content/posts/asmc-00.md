After the War to End All Wars (the second one), American soldiers, sailors and marines returned to their small towns or sprawling metropolises with a hunger to make up for the lost years.  It was a very serious time for serious people who were serious about wrestling their piece of the American Dream into existence.  It was a time of great change and seeking new paths for many people.

Thus it was the Dolan Donaldson found himself on a cool Spring day walking through an apple orchard on the outskirts of a small town in a series of small towns he had seen that year.  Officially, Dolan--or The Duck, as his friends called him--was a hair wax salesman.  He sold all types of wax: for mustaches and beards, for hair, for bald pates and receding hair lines.  The Duck traveled the "Cold Line" which was the path where the weather tended to stay just nice enough that his samples did not freeze or melt (much).  It was not The Duck's true calling in life, but it mostly paid the bills and the walking kept him in shape and far, far away from the expectations waiting for him in his own small town.

Periodically, The Duck came across those bastard son-of-bitches that worked for the competitor's hair wax traveling salesmen team.  Those were raucous nights filled with drinking and brawling.  Like him they were ex-Service men just trying to make their way in the world.  And like him they relished a good bust-up where you could walk away or crawl away with a lot of bruisers, but also still breathing.  These were serious times and murder even accidental was frowned on because there was a lot of living to do after the Krauts and their friends stole so much, so so much time from the rest of the world.

But, Dolan The Duck, he did not think much about such things.  He was an average looking man who had learned that small towns were full of widows and bored housewives and every once in a while an aging but still rambunctious heiress who set him up pretty for a month or two in exchange for a little...work around their country estates.  The Duck had met a lot of people in the last few years, yes, he had, and as far as he was concerned he would travel the Cold Line until the good Lord (or enough angry husbands) decided it was time he stopped.

So it was odd even to The Duck when he found himself stopped and looking up at a giant tree standing alone in the middle of a large apple orchard.  It was not an apple tree and in truth did not even belong in that part of the country from what he could tell.  But there it was and there he was, staring up at it, entranced.

Sometimes a man has to follow his instincts.  That had gotten The Duck out of (and into) more than one tight spot so he trusted it.  The Duck ran a hand over the bark of the large tree, feeling its roughness.  He half expected to get a splinter it was so rough, but he did not.  Instead he felt a sense of...something.  Something right, but also wrong.  As he was mulling over that his hand hit upon a small hole which a closer look showed to be a finger-sized indent that seemed to run all the way into the base of the tree.  He was tempted to poke a finger in but had learned from a bunch of bees over near Deerwoodton that holes in trees usually are inhabited.  So instead he grabbed a stick and shoved it into the hole.  There was resistance at first then gradually it slid in.

After about a bit of pushing The Duck stopped and walked around the tree.  He had shoved more than enough in that it should have broken through the other side.  But there was nothing there.  He went back to the stick which was sitting still about two feet out of the hole.   So, he pushed again harder.  Then harder still but did not find any resistance, nor when he checked, was the stick coming out the other side of the tree.  The Duck considered the stick and the tree and the hole for a few minutes then abruptly slammed the heel of his hand into the back of the stick.  For some reason, about a foot or so below the hole the stick came firing out and slammed hard into The Duck's balls, sending him to the ground squealing like a stuck pig.  The Duck rolled around cursing and spitting for sometime before he was able crawl onto his hands and knees.  His box of wax samples was on the ground, luckily unopened, but as he looked he noticed there was probably as best he could tell the most beautiful woman he had ever seen sitting on top of it.

"Hi," The Duck said.  The woman looked him over for a minute then stood and walked over to him.

"Janine," she said, offering him a hand.  When he took it he noticed how small and delicate her fingers were.  The Duck had known a lot of women over the years; in the War, there were the prostitutes who took his money; back home here, there were the women who took his forgettable, average face for a temporary distraction from boredom.  The Duck prided himself on being a new Renaissance man because he committed all of their names to memory and recommitted them every night before he went to sleep--because he had lost too many people over in the War to allow him to lose anything else.

But when The Duck touched that farm girl's hand, her in her homespun dress and with her wickedly green eyes, well, he just plain forgot those other girls' names.  Hell, he almost forgot his own name, standing there like a fish gulping air, trying to make his mind work right.

"Duck,  Donald, The Duck," he said.  A wry smile crossed the girl's lips.

"Is that so?" she said.  "Well, Mr. Duck, this is private property you're crawling around on.  You're more like than not to get shot up around here."

"Duck," The Duck said again.  The woman looked down at her hand and he realized he was still holding it.  The Duck started to drop it but she tightened her grip.  "Sorry for tress'pissin on your land," he said.  He was holding her left hand and when he realized there was no ring on it, not even a promise ring, his heart skipped a few beats then made up for it by slamming into his chest, loud and fast.

"Oh, not my land," she said, helping him to his feet.  "I just came to steal the apples like you."  She smiled at The Duck and that was pretty much it for him.

The Duck had been with a lot of women--mostly after the War when an average looking guy could do alright, but with Janine, no, sir, he waited until their wedding night.  He even cried silently for a bit after she was asleep that first night because he knew he had lost the name of every one of those other women.  And he knew that the part of him that cared was a lot less than the part of him that wanted to make space for the rest of his life with Janine.  The Duck was a serious man in a serious time, but the heart, when it finally wakes up, does not care for anything except whatever magic made it wake.  It hungers for the thing that gave it power in this serious world full of serious people since the heart is anything but serious while also being dead serious when it comes to what it wants.

The Duck never did go back to that field and pull that stick out of the hole in that strange tree.  Which turned out to be a bit of a mistake.  More than a bit, really.
