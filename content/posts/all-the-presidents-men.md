There were two things you could be sure of with Jack VINCENT‘s presidency. First he was a science buff so there was always something playing in the background in the oval office. Current current feed from NASA conference proceedings and lectures, even talksBy different scientific communities and debates. It wasn’t just American scientists We’re academics either. It could be disconcerting the constant drone in the background. Some people said that’s why he did it. But in truth he was a technocrat and a science geek. He spoke 14 languages and could read another 15 on top of that.The president loved learning he loves science he love math and oddly enough he loved dance It seemed out of character but as he often said we can’t be defined by levels lest we become nothing more than them.
