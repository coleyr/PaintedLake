Some nights the town just sucked.

Ethel loved her little town most days and had made peace with her waitressing job a long time back.  Unlike a lot of people she had been outside of the county for a while so she secretly considered herself just slightly more cultured than the rednecks and sleepy truckers who frequented the diner during the late hour shift.

"They're back," Betty said, looking over at Ethel.  Betty was short, plump and managed to say every statement with a shit-eating grin.  In 20 years, Ethel had never seen Betty's smile falter.  If there was a person that all of the world's cults missed out on it was Betty.

"So I see," Ethel said, not looking up from her crossword.  She had come in for her first shift, served a few Ironhorse Cowboys (the county's pseudo-biker gang), and been idle ever since.

The 'they' were Reginald T. Holmes and Mr. Tight-Ass-Yes-Baby.  Reginald was an infrequent customer who showed up once a fortnight at most and just sat and drank bad coffee for a shift or two.  He was quiet and kind of meely-mouthed.  Every once in a blue moon Mr. Yes-Baby would appear with him.  The two always took the same booth (second from the last) and chit chatted in low voices.

No one was sure who had given Mr. Yes-Baby is nickname but strangely it fit.  If Brad Pitt had had a wet dream about his hotter self that would be Mr. Yes-Baby.  He was tall, blonde, and so good looking a girl's eyes would hurt if she looked at him too long.  (Betty tried it once hiding in the kitchen.  She swore she saw spots for a week after that).

In Ethel's opinion, Mr. Holmes seemed not to like Mr. Yes-Baby.  When Mr. Holmes thought no one was looking he stared daggers at Mr. Yes-Baby.  So the queer rumors never really took.  To Ethel it almost seemed like Mr. Holmes was guarding the diner from his sexy friend.  He watched Yes-Baby like a hawk, even counting the forks and utensils when the latter left for the night.

"Can I get more coffee?" said a voice so deep it almost purred.  Everyone turned.  They always did.  Like marionettes on a string.  Mr. Yes-Baby was holding up his coffee cup.

In her haste to get over before anyone else, Betty practically bowled over a biker at the cash register who was waiting to pay his bill.  She expertly grabbed the coffee pot on the way by and came skidding to a halt in front of Holmes' and Yes-Baby's table.

Betty smiled somehow wider and Ethel turned away in mild irritation and disgust.  Most nights Ethel loved her small quaint town but every once in a while it just felt like a suffocating wet blanket that she could never find the edge of.

Across the room Betty cackled in that way that she thought sounded titillating.

"I've got to get a vacation soon--," Ethel muttered.  Across the room she heard someone groan.

"Mr. Holmes," she heard Betty say.  "Are you all right?  You look a little pale."

Ethel sighed and turned back to her crossword again.  She heard Yes-Baby laugh uproariously, probably at something Betty had said.

"Who am I kidding," Ethel muttered.  "This place is as good as most places, maybe better."  Yes-Baby was still laughing and it sounded like he was close to tears he was laughing so hard.  For some reason right at that moment she thought she could punch Mr. Yes-Baby square in the face and it would feel pretty good.

After a moment the odd thought passed.  "Ava!" Ethel said.  She had just figured out a piece of her puzzle.  "Ava Gardner!"  Then she sighed.  If it was right it made a few of her other answers wrong.

"I hate the New York Times," Ethel murmured and tossed the crossword in the trash.  Somewhere around there had to be a County Reveler paper that no one had gotten to the crossword on yet.
