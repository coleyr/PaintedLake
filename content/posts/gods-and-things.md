Why he hated the girl with the acerbic wit was unfathomable. But if the god really thought hard about it two reasons seemed to bubble up from the depths of his memory.

Years ago? Was it years or decades? Or even...? No humans did not live for centuries so it must be a millennia. Yes, the god thought, five millennia ago the girl was at his worship stone. She--years! Years! Why do they break their time streams into so many parts, the god cursed.

The girl, she was years younger, five years. Out in the hour when the veil between the Walls was thinner. Human children did not travel in this hour much so she caught his attention. Also, there was no one else around awake for miles. When had the humans stopped living close to his worship stone? Uncle Samhain's ascendancy? So many came back broken then and they moved their families to the edge of his influence and jurisdiction. "Sub-herds" the humans called the new enclaves where they clustered away from his worship stone.

The girl! The god struggled to hold the thread of that particular painful memory. The humans moved out from his stone and into little sun-herds. The girl was from a sub-herd near the edge of his domain. She was out of her hers dwelling...

Michelle kicked a stone on the sidewalk. It was slightly out of her path so she changed direction to make it "in her way". It felt pointless but then the entire night was pointless. Pointless existence in a pointless town with pointless sidewalks and a pointless stupid statue in the central garden of the town.

Michelle followed the stone and gave it another kick. It rolled a few feet. Kick, roll, follow, kick, roll, follow. Kick--!

Physics is a comforting thing. If you kick a rock 100 times it will go forward from your foot. It will generally go the same distance each time. But sometimes Physics is downright nasty. Why that kick was the one neither the god (though he had his suspicions) and Michelle never knew. But the rock went flying in a perfect arc across the lawn, through the wrought iron fence and directly into the nose of the God's statue.
