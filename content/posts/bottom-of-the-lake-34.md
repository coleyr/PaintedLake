Harry grabbed Doyle and pulled him back before he broke a hand.

Doyle collapsed, staring helplessly at the wall.  The dust had started to clear in the scene on the wall.  Young Doyle was holding the older man who was now missing an arm and most of his left leg.  Young Doyle was screaming but the lack of sound made it somehow more terrible.

The older man was moving his lips.  Young Doyle moved in close to hear him, cradling his burned, destroyed body.

"What did he say to you?" Velsa asked Doyle quietly.  She was standing in front of the scene on the wall.

Doyle mumbled something.  He was crying silently now.  "Mein Kleiner Junge," he said after moment.

"My baby boy...little one, maybe," Harry translated.

On the battlefield, the older man brought his hand up and caressed young Doyle's cheek, trying to wipe away the tears.  His hand left a trail of blood.

"No tears, my Little One," Doyle said.

The burned man pulled something from his inner coat pocket and handed it to young Doyle.  He looked at it and laughed in spite of himself and said something back.  The older man laughed and then clutched his stomach in pain.

"What--" Harry started.

Doyle reached into his shirt and ripped something off of a necklace.  He handed it to Harry.  It was an old battered rank insignia.  "We were mirrors, he and I.  My squad faced his and the two of us often had the same watches.  So we spent most of the time we were in that Hell hole staring across No Man's Land at each other."

The burned man gently pushed a fist into young Doyle's chin.  "The squad use to hold boxing matches with other squads up and down the trenches.  He must have seen me fighting once because one night he began doing that fake punch to his own face and pointing to me.  That was how we starting becoming more than enemies."  Doyle laughed softly.  He walked over to the wall and touched spot where the burned man lay.  "I thought he was challenging me.  Then the next day in a match I took a hard one on the chin and was down for three days.  Next watch we shared he did the same gesture on his own face and then pointed at me and shook his head."  Doyle caressed the wall tenderly.  "He was not wrong.  I was leading with my chin unconsciously.  Leaving it wide open."

Harry held up the insignia.  "This is not German."

Doyle looked back at Harry.  "No, it's English.  I had lost one two nights before on a raid into their territory.  He must have noticed mine missing when we shared a mirror watch the next night.  Maybe they had extras lying around.  We both lost a lot of men in the middle, he would have had spares."

In the battle scene, young Doyle gestured around at all of the destruction and dead bodies and the older man laughed hard but immediately grimaced and clutched his stomach.

"I told him he did not have to go to so much trouble to return it," Doyle said.  "'Next time, you come get'," Doyle said in the present, softly repeating the words of his opponent in the scene on the wall.  "'No make old man walk so far'."

The older man shuddered and young Doyle hugged him closer.  Both Doyles--present and past--started shaking their heads frantically.  Harry looked at Velsa sharply to see if it was a repeat of the group possession from earlier in the night but she was only staring at the wall curiously.

Doyle's opponent's eyes glassed over and some bubbles and sputum came out of his mouth.  Young Doyle wiped it away carefully with his hand and closed the man's eyes then he buried his face in the older man's shoulder.  He rocked slightly and Harry could see that the younger man's body was being racked with sobs.

Harry turned to say something to Doyle when Velsa pointed at the wall.  "Look."

On the wall, the burned man's eyes were open again, full of life. He was staring straight ahead as if he was looking into the room where Harry, Doyle and Velsa were.  His eyes moved from one to the other but stopped on Doyle.  Doyle's opponent mimed punching his own chin and smiled then he slung his hand out in front of him.  Something sailed out of his hand and through the air and Velsa, Harry and Doyle jumped back as there was a sound like a rip.  Something clattered onto the floor and slid, coming to a stop in front of Doyle's feet.

The scene on the wall flickered and for a moment the older man was whole and unburned.  He had young Doyle cradled in his arms now and was patting the younger man's back, speaking softly.

"I go," Harry translated.  "You safe now.  I go."

Doyle stared down at the item but made no move to pick it up.  "That one, however, is German, Harry," he said in wonder and horror.

"The Broken Sword," Velsa said softly.
