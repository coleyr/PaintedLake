Bess held Doyle's hand silently and counted seconds. It was like a hundred, maybe a thousand deja vus overlapping. She could feel Doyle's hand tightening ever so slowly.

He knows what Harry is about, she thought. A cavalier smile was plastered across Doyle's lips. He started to shoot her a confident wink then stopped. They had know each other too long. Instead he turned back to the stage and the giant metal contraption Harry was submerged in.

Bess felt a drop of water hit the back of her hand and looked up. They were near the front so it could have come from... Another drop. Bess scanned the audience around and behind her. A number of people were looking towards the rafters of the old theatre. They were feeling the drips as well.

"Doyle, there is--"

"Look!" He hissed. He yanked her hand roughly as he pointed at water filled metal structure. "Look! Look at it!"

The top where the seven locks were secured were rattling. "He can't get out!"

A drop hit Bess on her forehead and she looked up. Beside her she heard Doyle bellow and rush forward. She looked. He was climbing over seats and patrons not caring which got a boot or fist or knee.

"Open it!" He yelled to the girl on stage. He was struggling to get through the mass of confused bodies.

Another drop hit her. This time on her forearm. The theater's lights came on at the moment and she saw that the water wasn't water--it was dark red.

A woman screamed and then a man shouted as others noticed the same red staining their skin and clothes.

And Bess knew. Somehow she knew.

"Harry, no!"

She was moving before the words left her lips. Ahead of her Doyle was still scrambling but now the press of bodies was confounding his forward progress. Bess kicked off her shoes and began running over people. Other patrons screamed or cursed at her but she did not stop. In an instant she was past Doyle and then...

The orchestra pit! It was empty but deep in this old theater. Bess half fell, half dove across it. She knew she was not going to make it before her feet left the edge of the pit. Then she was falling and screaming.

A strong hand caught her arm yanking it painfully and stopping her fall. Bess looked up expecting to see Doyle but it was Harry's new stage assistant, the younger, blonder version of Bess. The woman grabbed Bess' arm with her free hand and began frantically backpedaling.

She is too weak to hold me, Bess thought. But the woman's terror apparently gave her strength. She strained, arching her back away from the pit and slowly pulled Bess onto the stage.

As soon as Bess's knees were on the woman let her go.

"There are too many keys," she yelled at Bess and thrust them forward into Bess's face. Bess grabbed them.

"I know," Bess said. She ran to lid checked the first lock. "132," she muttered, her hands flipping through the keys automatically. She found the right one and quickly unlocked it.

"They--" the woman started then stopped when she saw Bess was onto the 3rd lock. "How...?"

Bess talked as she worked. "Harry made me memorize the locks and their keys and backup keys. Good idea really. In case of something like this."

I am ranting, Bess thought. I need to--

The key to the 5th lock twisted and broke inside the lock. For a moment Bess stared at the mangled key in horrified fascination.

"Axe!" yelled a man behind her and she turned to see Doyle charging with a fire axe held above his head. She and Harry's assistant dove out of his way as he passed. He struck the lock and it and the head of the axe flew off and skidded across the stage. Doyle grabbed the metal container's lid and pulled.

Off stage, patrons were shouting at each other and clawing to get to the exits as the drops of red water (blood, Bess realized) became steady trickles around them.

"We have to get him out before the blood stops falling," she yelled to Doyle over the pandemonium.

"What?" he yelled back. He was still tugging on the top but it was stuck. Bess and the woman joined Doyle, straining against the stuck lid.

He is dead, she thought. Harry. No one could--

Another pair of hands, these enormous, grabbed the lid. It was Doyle's driver, Benson? Devin? Why am I so damn bad with names, she thought hysterically.

With a screech the lid ripped off. The two women and Doyle fell backwards onto the floor. Doyle's driver thrust a meaty arm inside the metal container and pulled out...

Not Harry! Bess's mind screamed at her. She climbed to her knees and scrambled forward on all fours.

"Who--"

Doyle's driver stared in shock at the small body in his arms. A small girl. A girl in a mud covered green dress, no not green, that it was white stained green by the mud and water, white with--

"Blue flowers," Bess whispered, horrified. She knew that dress. Had made it with her own hands.

How? Why? How had Harry...? Why had he..? Where...? What was...? Questions flashed through her mind in a jumble.

And Bess was falling somehow both backward and down into herself. The horror of that day so long ago, so buried...

Then the girl coughed and vomited a stream of murky black liquid. Mud, water....lake water, Bess thought.

Her eyes opened. "Mommie?"

Bess had the girl in her arms suddenly. She barely registered Doyle's driver's grunt as she elbowed him aside.

Her girl! Her Nell. Hers!

Tears streamed down Bess's face. If it was a dream...it was not a dream. Somehow Bess knew it. It was impossible but Nell was here. Alive.

"Mommie," the girl cried, clinging so hard to Bess that her arms were bruising under the tiny girl's grip. Bess covered her with kisses, tasting the foul mud and lake water and not caring.

"Here, baby," Bess cooed, stroking Nell's dirty hair. "Never let you go again."

"Gott in Himmel!" a voice yelled. Bess looked up to see Doyle and his driver dragging Harry out of the metal container. He was covered in--not mud--blood, Harry was covered in thick dark red blood. Dried blood.

She started to reach a hand out to him, but Nell clutched frantically and pulled Bess's arm back around her tiny body.

Harry was cursing and struggling as they dragged him out. Cursing in...it was not English.

Harry tried to swing a haymaker punch the two men. The driver ducked back in time but it caught Doyle square on the chin.

Harry cackled. "Still," he said in between guffaws, "slow. Still slow." Then he said something in that other language and collapsed onto the hardwood stage floor.

"Bloody bastard!" Doyle grunted. He ran a hand over his chin. "Go to Hell!"

Harry's eyelids fluttered open. He leered at Doyle. He sat up clutching Doyle by his lapels. He whispered something in a loud hiss then collapsed again. This time Doyle's driver caught him and lowered him carefully down. "'E'll be alright."

"I'll bring the car round, Mr. Doyle," he said quietly and climbed to his feet. He nodded to Bess, watched Nell for a moment then walked off into the wings.

Doyle stared down at Harry. He took out his handkerchief and dabbed carefully at Harry's face as if he was not sure where first to start cleaning off the blood. There was so much of it.

Doyle looked back at Bess, saw Nell in her arms and smiled.

"Stupid German bastard," he chuckled.

Bess had no idea of what he was talking about and realized she did not care. Doyle looked up sharply at where Dobbs had exited. He looked perplexed.

Harry groaned and stirred slightly.

"Harry?" Bess and Doyle said at the same time. Harry opens his eyes slowly and looked at the two of them then his eyes fell on Nell. He tried to sit up and failed. He settled for dragging himself by his arms and ignoring Doyle's outstretched hand.

He put a gentle hand on Nell's back. She sighed and hugged Bess tighter.

"Daddy," she whispered and leaned slightly backward, into his chest.

Then she craned her neck back to look at Doyle. "Where did the man go, Uncle Arthur?" She pronounced his name without the 't' sound. Like she always had.

"My German friend? He made it..." Doyle started, searching for the right words. He looked again where Dobbs had exited. "He made it home, I suppose."

"Good," the little girl said. "His face was scratchy but he was nice."

"Not nice, shortcake. But definitely good," Doyle responded.

The four of them sat in silence then for a long time. Each, even Nell, knew somehow that Dobbs and the car were never coming back. The German had a long way to go now.

The End
