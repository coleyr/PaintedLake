The hooded figure with the book and knife raised them both above his head and let out a long series of nonsensical syllables.

"Ardoth dres sopewere hiot," he said in a grave voice.

"Ardeth," said the woman. Even through the robe it was obvious she was short and portly. TJ's mind raced to figure out who it might be--someone in the town or a stranger he did not know.

"What?" said the man, lowering his hands slightly.

"It's 'ardeth', not 'ardoth'," the woman said." It is a hard 'e'."

The man dropped his hands to his side. "No, it is not. The book said 'ardoth'."

"I'm telling you, it's 'ardeth'," she replied. The hooded man turned to the figure on his right who shrugged.

"I thought it was 'ardoth', too. But it could be the other way." He was also male but had a soft shaky voice, like a squirrel or a mouse hiding from a cat.

"Well, which is it?" asked the hooded man with the book. "You are supposed to be the resident expert on this shit." He waved the book at the other man.

"Um, let me see the book again," the second man took a step forward.

"Stop, idiot!" The fourth figure snapped. The cloaked man reaching for the book stopped midstep, his foot in midair. "I told everyone not to cross the circle of salt after we started."

The man in midstep looked down. "Right." He carefully set his foot down outside the circle. "Are you sure we are supposed to be outside the circle? I seem to remember something about being inside the circle."

The woman sighed. " Did you even choose the right ritual?" she asked the man with the book and knife.

"Yes," the man replied scornfully. "I think I can at least manage that."

"The ritual we chose does not have 'ardoth' in it anywhere," she replied.

"Maybe we should start over," said one of the cloaked men.

The man with the book and knife practically screeched. "That was an hour of chanting and walking around this stupid salt circle. I am NOT going to do all of that again just because some stu--"

"Sugar," said the man who had tried to step over the circle.

"What?" asked the man with the book and knife.

"I couldn't find enough salt so I just took some of the sugars out of the cafeteria."

"Are you shitting me?! Sugar?" yelled the man with the book. He pointed the knife tip at the other man. "You can't just change a critical component of the spell."

"Well, you changed the word 'ardeth'," said the woman.

The hooded man pointed the knife at the woman. "So help me, I will--"

"People, please," said the fourth figure. He was rubbing his hand over his face beneath his hood. "We have a lot to do tonight and we still need to get these cloaks back to the theater costume room and get to the football game."

The man with the knife lowered it and the other two looked down at the ground. Behind the boilers Rodney stiffened. He looked over at the other kids and mouthed something.

"Something is wrong with the Power tonight," said the fourth figure. "It feels...dispersed." He sounded slightly confused. He pointed a finger at the woman when she started to speak. "No," he said. "Just no."

He took a moment to collect himself then raised his arms. "Oh great Mint-E-No-sea, hear the pleas of your humble servants who come before your in secret tonight." He signaled for the other three to begin to walking the circle again.

"We ask that you use your vast and unknowable Power to convince the foreigners not to close the factory."

"And the basketball State Championship," said one of the hooded men.

The fourth hooded man paused. "What?"

The hooded man who had spoken stopped causing the other two to crash into his back. Over the grumbling he said, "That championship means a lot to the Town. I think it's as important as a bunch of jobs."

"You mean important to your job," said the hooded woman acerbically.

"Fine," the fourth hooded man said slowly through clenched teeth. "Save the water bottling factory and the boys basketball team needs to win the State Championship this year."

"And the big game tonight," said the woman.

"TJ doesn't need some goddamn Power to win the game tonight," said the man with the knife and the book.

The woman crossed her arms.

"Okay," the fourth man said, exasperated. "Everyone silently think of one--and only one--thing they want. We will ask Mint-E-No-sea for a blanket blessing for those things."

"Broughton is a tough team," the woman said sullenly. "It isn't going to hurt TJ to have a little something extra out there."

The man with the book and knife shook his head and started walking again. "I cannot wait until that overgrown oaf graduates," he muttered.

"That boy is a nice boy," the woman said as she began walking. "His parents are real shitheads to him and he works so hard for this town."

The man with the book and knife muttered something else under his breath.

The fourth man rubbed at his temples then raised his arms to continue. "Hear our pleas!" He dropped his arms.

Behind the boilers TJ and Michelle both doubled over in pain. Daniel and Rodney exchanged worried glances. Daniel crawled over to them unsure what to do. He waved at Rodney to keep watching the hooded figures.

After minute TJ and Michelle stopped rolling on the ground and sat up.

"Are you two okay?" Daniel whispered. After moment both nodded.

"Let's get this over with," they heard one of the men say.

Rodney crawled over. "We have to go! Now!" he whispered.

"I am fine. Thanks," said Michelle. She was still clutching her chest. TJ was still on the ground, his eyes unfocused. He was clutching his legs against his chest, curled into a fetal position.

"Can he move?" Rodney asked. "If not we need to move him." He shot a nervous glance through the opening between the boilers. The hooded figures had stopped moving and chanting. The were congregating on one side of the circle now, struggling with something.

"Be careful with those," one of the hooded men, maybe the leader, said.

TJ waived a hand and nodded. He could move. Rodney pointed to a window along the wall. TJ nodded and climbed unsteadily to his feet. He limped over to the window, one hand still clutching just below his stomach. He stood on tiptoe and undid the latch. It squealed slightly and he winced. He started gesture to the others when his mouth suddenly dropped open.

The others followed his horrified gaze and turned around to see...

There was a flabby, milky-white mild aged man ass visible between the boilers.

"Just give me a minute," they heard the woman grumble and the sound of cloth rustling.

TJ lifted the window and frantically waved the others forward. They raced over and TJ practically threw Michelle up and out the window.

"What--" Daniel started to say looking back then was cut off as TJ grabbed him and tossed him through the open window. He cleared it easily and landed on the ground a few feet from it. Rodney quickly followed in the same manner then the two of them reached their hands down to pull TJ up and out.

They heard one of the men say "We need more people."

Then the four were running as fast as they could; Michelle cursing and TJ moaning as they went. When the made it to the parking lot Rodney signaled for them to hide behind some of the parked cars on the edge near one of the lot light poles.

Michelle put a hand on the pole to steady herself. TJ collapsed to his knees.

"What the hell was that?" he said, panting.

"Sex cult," Rodney said, looking back the way they came.

"Were those teachers?" Michelle asked.

"Three of them were, I think," Rodney said.

"And they were about to--What?" Michelle said, noticing the other three staring at her.

She looked down and gasped. Her breasts had grown by at least a cup size and were straining against her bra and shirt, painfully. She covered them with her hands.

"What the...? Wait!" She looked up. "We're one of you thinking about...we're one of you thinking about my tits while a bunch of knife wielding cultists were 6 feet away?" Rodney, TJ and Daniel exchanged uncomfortable glances. She looked into each of their faces, each looked away quickly, Daniel blushing.

"All" Michelle drew the word out, "of you were thinking about my tits."

"I swear it wasn't me," TJ said. "I find you repulsive."

Daniel shook his head.

"I'm an ass man," Rodney said.

"Ass hat," Daniel said smiling.

Michelle cast a glance over her shoulder back the way they had come. "Oh that is so groddy to the max!"

"Might have been the old woman," TJ said.

"Very fun--". Then she stopped and looked over at TJ closely. "Move your hand."

"Why?" TJ asked slowly pulling back his hand.

Daniel and Rodney both stared, shocked. They both quickly looked away. Michelle smirked.

"So," she snickered. "That is a 'little something extra'?"

TJ angrily covered his nether regions with his hand. Then he put a second hand over it.

"It looks like you have a thermos shoved into your pants," Michelle said.

"It's not funny!" TJ yelled. He pointed down. "How am I supposed to play with this?!"

"I'd say with three hands," Rodney snickered. That set Michelle and Daniel off and they started laughing.

"I'm glad I'm not hiking the ball for you," Daniel laughed.

Tears were streaming down his face. He, Rodney and Michelle had fallen to their knees. The boys were laughing so hard they were clutching their stomachs. Michelle was alternating between clutching her stomach because she was laughing so hard and covering her sore breasts.

"This could end my football career," TJ said.

"Or start a new one in porn," Michelle laughed. She was actually snorting in between her laughs.

"Please," TJ said, he pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes in frustration. "This whole night...just stop. I can't take any more. Please!"

"That's what she said," Michelle guffawed and the three laughed even harder.

TJ scowled. "There's nothing I can say right now that won't turn into a penis joke, is there?"

"I don't know," Rodney said. "Let's run it up the flagpole and see."

Daniel was rolling on the ground now, gasping. He was trying to talk but couldn't stop laughing.

"At least part of you will always be on time to class now," Michelle said. "Besides if anyone should be upset it's me. You three turned me into Christy Canyon."

Rodney and Daniel abruptly stopped laughing. All three boys looked at her. "How do you know who that is?" Rodney said.

"You think boys' dads are the only ones with a VCR in this town?" Michelle said, smirking at their sudden discomfort.

"Duck!" Daniel said suddenly.

"Why?" Michelle laughed. "Because 'Tripod' here is going to--"

Daniel dove, grabbed her and pulled her and TJ down to the ground beside him. Rodney dove down beside them. A moment later they heard frantic footsteps run past.

"...window was open so we need to check..." a male voice said as the footsteps passed. Daniel could make out a pair of penny loafers as the two sets of feet ran by.

For a few minutes the four were silent, barely breathing. They clutched at each other unconsciously, scared to move. The laughter was gone, replaced with something more akin to terror. Ten minutes passed, then fifteen. Nothing.

"I don't think they are coming back," Daniel said.

"We should still go," Rodney said.

"Thank you for saving us back there, TJ," Michelle said. Everyone was silent for second, waiting.

"Uh, sure," TJ said slowly. "It was, you know, I mean, no problem."

"And TJ?" Michelle said. "You're not a dick. Not completely anyway."

TJ groaned and shoved Michelle and the other two off of him. They all sat up.

"A bunch of real comedians," he said but there was none of his usual surliness in the words. He was also smiling. The others noticed both but did not comment.

"I need to get to the locker room and get ready for the game," he said getting to his feet. He looked down. "And whatever with this."

"We'll be in the stands," Rodney said, standing. He extended a hand to Michelle to help her up. Daniel gave Rodney a questioning look--football games were not their thing--no sport was.

"Wait!" Daniel said. He pointed at TJ's crotch. "We can use that!" The other three looked at him, waiting for the joke. "No I mean if Michelle didn't wish for it then whoever did will be watching to see if it worked. Rodney and I hate football anyways so we can keep an eye on the stands." TJ shot them an annoyed look.

"You could see that thing from space," Michelle said and TJ unconsciously dropped a hand to try to cover his groin. "No one's going to have a hard time spotting it."

"This is so not cool," TJ muttered.

"You'll be on the sidelines reporting, Michelle," Rodney said. "You watch our side of the stands and Dan and I will watch the Broughton side."

"I'm not turning my back on that thing," Michelle said, a gleam of humor in her eyes. Then she became serious. "We need to be careful. Something odd is happening in this town and now we know about it. People who do bad things in private like to keep it that way."

"You probably shouldn't talk to Daniel or Rodney or me," TJ said. "People will wonder why...". He trailed off. Sometimes the gulfs between two people in different social circles in high school were wider than two people standing on opposite sides of an ocean.

"No," Michelle said immediately. "Screw them. Screw everyone. I talk with who I want."

"Technically, no one wants to talk to you, Second Place," TJ said, but he was smiling.

"Pipe it, Pipe," she shot back, also smiling.

"Not if we have another 'TJ twister pile'," Daniel said, half under his breath.

They all looked at Rodney, expectantly. He looked at each one in turn, deadly serious.

"After School Murder Club," he said simply. "That's what we should call the new club."

"Illegitimi non carborundum," TJ said and put a hand out, palm down. I actually have friends , he thought.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Michelle said. I barely find these guys repulsive, she thought and covered TJ's hand with hers.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Daniel said and added his hand. I'm touching a girl , he thought.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Rodney said, putting his hand on top of the pile. x3 + y3 + z3 = 42. Cool! , he thought.
