Nelson Decker really never had a chance.  Or so that is what people who knew him said.  There were a lot of cliques at Nelson's school: the preps, the nerds, the drama kids, the jocks, the screw ups, the cheerleaders, and a lot more and then there was Nelson.  He fit into exactly none of them.

He could have been a jock because he was big and tough.  Once he had even put his fist through a locker to prove that point and the half of the football team who had been getting ready to jump him decided they were late for practice.   He could also take a beating.

He could have hung with the screw ups but found them boring.  Drama kids?  Too weird.  Nerds?  He had considered selling his services as a body guard to them but then he would be following them into some stupid proto-chemical-advanced-quantum-physics-engineering-Advanced-Placement-Class for-smart-kids-with-too-much-time-and-hair-on-their-hands.  The metal heads were a one trick pony.  The preps would not give him the time of day.  And so on.  There were all the cliques at Villhana High and then there was Nelson or "Decker" as people called him.

He mostly just held up the wall beside the cafeteria.  Once or twice a day he would get bored and mosey off to a class or two, but the majority of the time he spent with himself.  Periodically, Vice Principal Smythe would see him cutting class and hanging around the corridor to the boiler room.  He would chase him around the school for a bit but Nelson fast.  He considered those little truancy runs as calisthenics to keep him sharp.  And Nelson needed to stay sharp.

Though he was starting to suspect that Smythe was just doing it for the exercise, too, because he had definitely slowed down once or twice or missed a turn and run on by when Nelson tripped up or got caught on the fence he was trying to scale.  Or maybe he did not want to catch Nelson for other reasons.  Smythe was the only adult in the school as big as Nelson.  On more than one occasion he had stopped a fight simply by holding the two combatants apart by their collars.  Once Smythe had stopped a bigger fight between ten kids but that had not been pretty.  Everything had been fine until someone got a lucky (or unlucky) punch that put one kid out of the fight but continued on into the side of Smythe's head.  It was like a switch flipped in Smythe.  A few of the combatants broke off and began to back away, sensing the shift but it was too late.

Nelson had been watching from his usual 2 o'clock cutting spot on the football field bleachers and could see into the main corridor where the fight had broken out.  It took about fifteen seconds before every kid was on the ground and it had been like watching an enraged bear tearing through the--

"Watch it," yelled a voice.  Someone smashed into Nelson and as expected they got the worst of it.  Nelson looked down to see Michelle Something.  She looked pissed.  Papers were scattered around her and she began frantically picking them up.

"You walked into me," Nelson said, standing above her.

Michelle looked up.  "What?"

"You walked into me.  It's your fault," Nelson said suddenly, feeling slightly awkward.

She stared at him and her top lip started to quiver slightly.  She stood up.  "You know nothing about nothing," she screamed, her face inches from his.

For second he had an almost irresistible urge to kiss her.  Nervously, he laughed, but as soon as he did her face twisted in rage and he realized she thought he was laughing at her.  He opened his mouth to speak but she slapped him.  That was something he understood.  He touched his cheek where she had slapped him.  He looked down at her and grinned.  "Not bad."  She slapped him again, three times and the last one actually stung slightly.  Michelle looked up at him defiantly and then something in his face made her slap him again.  This time one of her rings caught him and sliced his cheek slightly.  She shrank back immediately and looked at the trickle of blood on her hand, astonished.

Nelson reached out and took one of the papers she had been in the process of picking up. He wiped it across his face, cleaning off the blood.  He held it out to her.  "Last one was pretty good, but you have a lot to learn about ass-kicking."

Michelle looked slightly dazed, like a deer in the headlights (or at least, what Nelson expected they would look like since he had never actually seen one and had no car to drive).  Still looking him in the eye, Michelle reached out to take the paper slowly then her eyes looked down at it.  In that moment something changed in her posture and demeanor, not unlike Smythe that day at the Main Corridor.  Like the kids in the brawl, Nelson saw it a second too late.  Michelle slammed her fist into his stomach, hard.  He doubled over and oof-ed as the air went out of him.  Before he could stand up she landed six quick punches along the side of his head.  He backed up and put his hands up defensively as she began swinging wildly.  He was able to deflect most of them but in spite of her small size she was managing to score a good hit one in every five swings.

Michelle stopped suddenly and screamed, "I hate you!  Everyone does.  Everyone!"  Then she ran off, clutching her papers to her chest.  He watched her go and massaged his left arm. She's a South Pole, he thought.

He realized he was still holding her paper, held it up to read, and then looked up after Michelle as she disappeared down the hallway.  "Crap," he said softly.  For a second he considered following her but then realized he had no idea what he would say.

The paper was a picture of Sarah Jane Williams and he blood was smeared across her face and over the 'g' in the word 'Missing'.

"Crap," he said again.
