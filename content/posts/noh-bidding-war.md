The smells of sweat and stale refrigeron blasted Callie as the door to the Pit slid open.  Even through her mask it was a disgusting combination, each competing to make her retch.  But it was understandable.  Ranklers were not drawn from the silk masks of society.  Most of them were barely a step beyond neanderthals.  And the Pit was not where you took a first date--unless you never wanted to see them again (alive or dead).

A few ranklers she knew made eye contact and gave a quick nod before looking away.  Callie nodded to them as she passed, looking for an open and relatively clean cube to bid from.  After 5 years, she had yet to get over the claustrophobic feeling in the Pit.  Everyone was packed in like sardines, barely two feet between them.  It made her skin crawl at the sight of so many bodies practically piled onto each other.

Callie managed to snag a cube a few rows back from the podium.  She tapped a finger over the cube's interface jack, letting her gloves autoclave it clean.  It was not uncommon to see some rankler shoving a Q-Tip into a jack in a vain attempt to clean it.  Why bother, Callie always thought.  She had paid up for her retractable gloves, getting all the bells an whistles like Jack Cleaner.  It had turned out to be a prudent choice.

"Callista-san," a raspy voice croaked to her left.  A large man in a trench coat two cubes down raised a worn, dirty gloved hand in greeting and waved. Or at least he tried to wave. Miles, or Little Miles as he was called, was so big he could barely fit into the plexiglass cubical. His wave looked like he was trying to scrub the side of the plexiglass clean.

"Miles-san," Callie scowled trying to ignore his impolite gesture. Why not just to grab me with your meathooks ? Callie thought.

She tapped the left side of her mask with her first and third fingers.

Little Miles obviously saw her gesture but ignored it. The old timers had no manners. "Heard you had some action on the way in," he said. "A Blue Piller."

Callie nodded. She scanned the auditorium stage. No one at the podium yet to save her from Miles' dry banter. She sighed and turned her eyes back to him.

"Jumped out in front of the guy in front of me."

Little Miles raised an eyebrow then swiped three fingers diagonally down his broad chest. A suicide ?

Callie shrugged. "Maybe. He was at least a red pillar." Callie thought for a moment, trying to remember the dead man's face. "Maybe blue pillar."

Miles' eyes crinkled slightly in what appeared to be a wry smile behind his mask. Callie sighed. The old timers were all like that. Hard to read. Often forgetting to use proper hand language. Always seeming to be laughing at jokes only they understood.

Little Miles nodded and turned back towards the podium. The conversation was apparently over.

"I saw his face. His whole face," Callie said suddenly. She was not sure why she had said it.

Little Miles slowly turned his eyes back to her. "He was a Maskless?" There was no amusement in his eyes now.

Callie shook her head. Little Miles pried his massive girth out of his cube. She could almost hear the cube sigh as it retracted its plexiglass walls back to standard width. Miles reached into the cube beside her and grabbed its occupant by the collar and pulled him out. The man spluttered in anger then quickly disappeared into the crowd once his eyes reached the top of Little Miles' head.

Miles shoved himself into the cube. He leaned close. "Tell me exactly what happened."

"The guy jumped out in front of a car in front of me. Didn't look like a suicide; just bad timing judgement. I got out to help--"

"Did you touch him?" Little Miles asked. He eyes were piercing. Callie had never been this close to Little Miles. Most people kept the minimum 6 feet plus a little extra "to be polite". Now he looked like a 'Roid head stuffed into a priest's confessional.

Callie started to gesture 'no' then stopped. "Yes, actually. He..."

Little Miles' face pressed into the plexiglass, bowing it inward slightly toward her. "He what?"

"He asked me to take it off," Callie said. She waited for the revulsion to register in Little Miles' eyes. It did not. Instead then peered hard at her then looked away thoughtfully.

"I see."

Callie waited for him to say more. Miles shifted his bulk back towards the podium. Callie turned her attention back to it as well.

"Where was this accident?" Little Miles asked after a few minutes.

Callie told him the cross streets to give him a general idea. It was outside the Sprawl but just barely. Little Miles nodded.

"Did you detox your hands before you came in? Salas won't be happy if she hears--"

"She did." Derrick said, coming up behind her. She jumped. How did he do that? Come up behind her so silently. Little Miles had jumped, too, which made her feel slightly better.

"I made her detox them twice before I got back in the car with her. Face, too. And cycle a fresh mask."

Little Miles looked between her and Derrick. "I see." He turned slightly so that he could see Callie. "Wait here," he said then pried himself out of the cube and walked off down the aisle way. People cleared for him like ice from an ice breaker ship.
