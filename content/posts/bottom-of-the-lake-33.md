Doyle flipped the card without hesitation and picked it up.  He showed it to Harry and put it on the table in front of  Velsa.

"The Broken Sword," she said.  She tapped it lightly with one long tapered finger.

"What does it mean?" Doyle asked.  He was wearing his confident smirk, but Harry could sense a slight unease in his manner.

Velsa looked at the card again, her performer's mask dropping momentarily.  "I do not know."

"Pardon?" Doyle asked.

Velsa's mask was in place.  "Ah the Broken Sword is...a man of steel, broken in soul."

"That is ludicrous," Harry laughed.  "You made that up just now."

Velsa ignored him.  She picked up the flash stick and held it forward and triggered it.  There was a loud snap and a brilliant flash.  For a moment, Harry was blinded then he heard Doyle whispering softly beside him.

"No...no...no..." Doyle said in horror.  Harry followed Doyle's hard stare across the room where the daguerreotype camera was projecting a moving picture out of its backside onto the wall.  Somehow the lights in the room had dimmed considerably.

In the moving picture was a scene of carnage and chaos.  Men stabbed at each other with bayonets and long, wicked-looking knives.  One man grabbed another man and dragged his knife across a man's throat spilling only to be shot in the back by another man.  Velsa looked away and covered her eyes.  Thankfully, there was no sound but the scene was vivid and life-like.  Harry slowly walked forward and pushed on the wall making sure a window into Hell had not opened up before them.  The wall was solid.

"Hell?" Harry asked Velsa.

"The War," Doyle said softly.  "My unit.  A terrible, terrible mistake."

As Harry looked he realized he realized he could make out different uniforms on the men.  Slowly, the men killed each other off until there were only a few struggling and then only two combatants.  The rest lay dying or dead.  The two men faced off warily, both held long knives drenched in blood and gore.

"In the end there was just the two of us," Doyle whispered.  "The way it had always been really.  Our own personal War."

As Harry peered at the moving figures he noticed that one resembled a younger Doyle.  The young Doyle was strangely fresh-faced but also had a look a terror and unbridled rage in his eyes.  The two men suddenly charged each other, exchanging blows and swiping with the knives.  Each landed a few shots or scored superficial wounds but nothing decisive.  The broke apart, stepping over bodies as they watched each other.  Then unexpectedly the man opposite young Doyle laughed.  Doyle laughed manically beside Harry then covered his mouth.  When Harry looked back to the moving picture he saw that younger Doyle was also covering his face trying to stifle a laugh.

"That bastard," Doyle said as he got himself under control, but it was said with tenderness.  Young Doyle's opponent knelt down and stabbed his knife into the ground and stood back up.  He lifted his hands slightly to show they were empty.  He stepped away from the knife and raised his fists.  Young Doyle looked down at his own knife and then tossed it a few feet away.  He raised his own fists and nodded, smiling.

"That is insane," Harry said.

Doyle chuckled.  "We were both amateur pugilists.  It seemed like the right place at that moment."

Both men circle again and moved until they found a spot relatively clear of bodies and discarded or dropped weapons.  The older man inched forward and drew a long line in the dirt with his foot.  Younger Doyle stepped forward and placed his foot on it and his opponent did the same.  Harry noticed that Doyle's opponent was an older man, maybe a career soldier.  Then the two men began exchanging blows.  Harry was fascinated as both men dodged and weaved and slung the fists at each other but rather than just brute punching both men moved as if in a fixed and violent dance.  They were artists.

"I never saw you fight," Harry said.  "You were good."

"I am still good," said with annoyance.  "He was better though, in so many ways.  But unlucky, too."

Doyle gestured toward the scene on the wall as the older man, young Doyle's opponent slipped.  He fell on his butt and looked up at young Doyle in surprise then both men laughed.  Young Doyle stepped forward and extended a hand and helped his opponent up.  The men took their places on the line and as they began exchanging blows again Harry could see the looks of sheer joy on both men's faces.

"You are smashing the Hell out of each other..." Harry said in amazement.

"Yes," Doyle said, wistfully.  "Life made sense in that moment.  Simple."

Young Doyle's opponent stepped back from the line and looked into the air.  Young Doyle spun around and looked up.  Both men could obviously hear something and Harry could see the terror on their faces.  Suddenly, Doyle's opponent charged forward tackled him, covering him with his body.  A massive explosion rocked the scene and bright, blinding white light seared Harry's eyes.

"No!" Doyle yelled, standing.  He rushed the wall and slammed his fists against it.  He turned back to Harry.  "Help me!"  He began trying to shove into the wall.  "Help me, God damn you!"
