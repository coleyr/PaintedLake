Calowyn stared at her hands.  Over and over she enveloped them and then retracted her gloves.  Her hands had long since been sanitized.  Or most of them had.  She still held her retractable mask nodes balanced on the tips of her index fingers so the gloves could not quite make it completely over them. I touched his face. Extend, flip the nodes to the next fingers, balance the nodes, retract, rebalance the nodes, extend...  There was no reason for it.  The two mask nodes too had been relinked for a while now.  She did not look down at her fingers.  Instead in her mind's eye she stared into the dying man's eyes looking up into hers.  There was no fear in them, no peace, nothing profound on the tip of his tongue.  His expression was blank.  If eyes were the window to the soul then his had checked out long before his body.  Calowyn had wondered for years what the eyes of the dead looked like right before they went.

"What a let down," she mumbled.

"Callie," said Jakub from behind her, awkwardly.  Calowyn sighed then reattached her mask nodes behind her ears.  The mask immediately flowed forward, covering her face.  It was just far enough away from her skin to make it almost imperceptible but close enough to provide the subconscious security of the knowledge it was there, protecting her from the world.

"Are you..." Jakub said.  What did they use to say in the Old Days?

"Yes, I'm decent," she responded, smiling.

"What?" he said, confused.  She could almost hear his virtual assistant trying to use the available definitions of the word to provide some sort of context.

"'Decent'.  It means I am wearing clothes or in this case a mask."

"Oh," he laughed, still slightly uncomfortable.  "Oldspeak."  And like that the spell was broken, danger averted, the beast in the bushes was gone.  He came and sat beside her on the hood of their car.  He put out a gloved hand.  For a moment, she thought he was offering her his hand then she noticed the thickness of his gloves.  Her eyes darted towards the containment van.  The EVAC team was working the corpse over and the sanitizing the ground around him.

"No, not him," Jakub said.  "He's still getting processed.  This one's..." he held out his palm.  His glove displayed a small hologram.  "Oh, across town.  Way across."

Calowyn could see the tip of a small brown boot sticking out of the EVAC's body bag.  "Sloppy," she muttered.  Jakub followed her gaze then jumped up and stormed over to the EVAC unit.  He pointed at the protruding boot while conveying his less than stellar assessment of the team's techniques and...yes, also their parentage.  One of the EVAC techs quickly knelt down to fully close the body bag while his partner stood chagrined in the face Jakub's barrage.  Calowyn smiled. So, so young , she thought.

She stood and stretched.  The sun had broken through the low hanging clouds and the day was heating up.  "Jakub," she subvocalized into her mask.  He stopped his harangue long enough look back her way.  Thick red Warrant gloves flowed over her hands and she gestured him over.  The red was unmistakable from that distance and he blanched.  Immediately, he spun on his heel and began to jog back to the car.  The standing EVAC tech's shoulders sagged slightly inside his hazmat suit as he noticed Calowyn's Warrant gloves.  He knelt down quickly by the body bag and found something very interesting on the ground that needed his full attention.  Satisfied, she turned to Jakub who was now waiting patiently at attention 6 feet to her left.

"Kronas," he said formally.  Then his tone faltered.  "Callie, I was just--"  Calowyn stared hard into his eyes until his voice trailed off.  The presence of the gloves were a hard rebuke.  "Kronas, I apologize for my temerity."  Calowyn let the words hang between them as she compartmentalized his beautiful face into a little box in her mind.

"You have a strong interest in the goings-on of EVAC teams.  Perhaps you should return there," she said softly.

Emotions flowed over Jakub's terrified, but still exquisitely beautiful face.  Years of hard work, years of clawing his way up, were dangling in the wind.  From a little imaginary string tied to her blood-red Warrant gloves.  Transfer back to the EVAC teams would be starting all over again, only now with the known disapproval of a Warrant officer.  A Watch-Warrant officer actually, Calowyn reminded herself.  She needed to be careful.  She could see by the slight shudders of his mask that Jakub's breathing was growing slightly more frantic.

"Please, Calowyn," he whispered.  "Please don't." I need to start working with uglier boys, Calowyn thought sourly.

"Never forget again," she whispered, but her voice hissed with all the venom she could muster.  It was a considerable amount.  Warrants did not make Watch by anything except by a cold, ruthless and single minded dedication to duty.  Sometimes as a distraction or even an experiment she played at being a friend or lover or both; but once the game or experiment was over... "Now, go play with the techs."

She had been about to add that he could get a ride back with the EVAC crew and she would have him reassigned to a junior Warrant.  It would sting and be a loss of face and a roadblock in his career path--but not an insurmountable one.  But he spoken before she could finish.

"I saw you.  You took your mask off.  Everyone saw you," he said hotly.  The little box where had carefully place her memory of his beautiful face slammed shut.

Calowyn's head cocked slightly to the side and she regarded him the way you would a bug you were about to smash.  Jakub's face fell before the words left his mouth.  She stepped closer and reached up and gently grabbed his chin between her gloved thumb and forefinger.  She slowly turned his head from side to side so that he could see the crowd of people milling around watching the two of them out of the corners of their eyes.

"Do you want to ask any of them what they saw?  Because I can tell you.  They saw what you did," she said.  Her voice was no longer a whisper but it was still quiet.  "They saw nothing."  She turned his face back so that they were looking each other in the eye.  Their masks were almost touching.  "And you saw..."

"Nothing," he said softly.

"You saw an old man get hit by a car," Calowyn said as she released his chin.  "You saw me talk to the old man--"

"Pre-," Jakub interrupted then immediately looked away.

Calowyn scowled.  "You went to call in the EVACs.  When you returned the old...the Pre--like some Pre's do--had taken off his mask before he died."  Jakub was staring at the ground, fully aware of how much between them had been just a game or some sort of fantasy conjured in his mind.  "You saw me maintain standard protocol the entire time."

Jakub nodded.  He looked so dejected that Calowyn almost relented.  Almost.

"Now, go play tech," she said and shooed him away with a condescending fluttering of her fingers.
