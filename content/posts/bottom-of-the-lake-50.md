Doyle stared at the wall, waiting.  Harry could see every muscle in his body was tensed, ready to...actually, Harry had no idea what Doyle was readying himself for.

Madame Zoska checked the camera's lenses for a final time.  "This worked last time, my dears, so let us see if we can delve once more into the Spirit Realm with our questions."  Her voice purred slightly.

"You are enjoying this," Harry said sourly though his professional curiosity was piqued. How does a fraud act when she is unexpectedly proven to be true? "Did you bring the offerings?" Madame Zoska asked.  Doyle did not acknowledge the question so Harry bent over and retrieved a small flask and a bag of something fragrant.  He handed it to the medium.

Zoska poured the contents of the bag into a small bowl and lit the with a nearby candle.  Smoke quickly filled the room, stinging Harry's eyes.

" Nochmal ?" someone asked.

"What was that, Doyle?" Harry asked.  He was having trouble finding his seat.

"What?" Doyle said.

"Frisch geschnittenes heu."

Doyle's face loomed out of the smoke.  "You brought hay?  Why hay?"

The smoke was starting to clear.  "My dears," Zoska said quietly.  "Perhaps--"

"One moment of quiet, please, madame," Doyle snapped.  "What about the hay, Harry?"

Harry shook his head then when he realized Doyle could not see it said, "I did not say anything about hay, Doyle."

"Kein gas!"

"Open a window, Dobbs!" Doyle yelled.  He jumped to his feet.  "Harry, come on!  They are gassing us!"  He grabbed Harry's arm forcefully and pulled him up.

"Oh dear!" Madame Zoska said.  Through the haze Harry felt her grab his wrist.  Hard.

"Harry, come on, God damn it!" Doyle bellowed.  He yanked Harry forward, half pulling, half dragging him across the table.  Zoska yanked hard on his wrist and he slid back towards his chair.  He yelled in pain.

Something was wrong.  The room was starting to clear of smoke.  Harry looked around and saw Dobbs struggling to open the window.  Harry had trained himself over the years to separate his perception from his body.  It was how he was able to stay calm for his tricks--panic was Death.

"Kein gas!" Zoska said again, more frantically.

"Not gas," she said.

Her voice, Harry thought.  It sounded different both times.  Why did it--

"Doyle, stop," Harry said suddenly.  If he had yelled it Doyle would have not registered it, but Harry's voice was so calm that it stopped Doyle's frantic pulling.  He turned back and looked at Harry with wide, wild eyes.

"What?"

"Was willst du von mir?" Zoska said.

"What?" Doyle said again, but slowly.  He looked past Harry to Zoska.

"Wieso rufst du mich an?" Zoska said.

"I did not call..." Doyle's next word died on his lips.  He peered intently at the old medium.

"Gott im Himmel," Doyle said.

"Nicht Gott," Zoska said.  She smiled crookedly.  "Nicht Himmel"

"No," Doyle said.  "I do not suppose it would be Heaven for you, old friend.
