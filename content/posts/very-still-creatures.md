Reed Green is a hunter. He wears camo to all occasions and wears shooting glasses in place of sunglasses. He is a man who behaves in a way that says he is terrified someone may be unsure of his hobby. Every morning of deer season he wakes at four thirty, drinks a black cup of coffee and smears himself brown green doe piss in that order. He wades out into the forest and climbs a small ladder overlooking a field on his fathers land. Hours pass in cool silence but he remains wide awake, eyes darting at every lizard sneeze or chipmunk fart.

One morning out on his stand a little before five o'clock in the morning he had a strange experience. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a dim figure outlined in the dark. The shape moved in and out of perception undulating under waves a deep blue morning gloom. He raised his rifle and peered down the scope. The shade of color deepened on and off, like it was going far away and coming back suddenly. It may be a twelve pointer, he thought considering the figures head on his bedroom wall. His eyes narrowed and he brought his finger to the trigger.

"Where is he!?" Reed heard a accented voice in the darkness. Reed let out a tight breath as he relaxed his finger. Still keeping it resting on the trigger guard. Who was out here? Big Steve? Little Robert? Krazy Kathleen? He didn't recognize the voice and he wasn't fond of foreign talk. Reed decided to keep quiet.

"There you are you dick! It's freezing out here, why the hell couldn't we have just met at Pearl's? It smells like goat piss out here"

The voice from the darkness asked in a un place able but think accent. "Shhhh!" A second gravely voice retorted. "We are out here with just the animals. I needed to be sure, in town there is too much tal (as in mortal) smell. Here I can know, no tal, no cousins." Reed wondered what kind of commie bullshit was taking place and tried to keep his breath slow and silent.

"I got it" The grovely voice said in a low but gleeful tone.

"got what? " The first voice said flatly.

"You stupid fuck, the answer to your question?!" The grovely voice shouted in a whisper.

"Wh.."

"Don't say what question, the fuckin expansion shit you and me talked about." The groveler grumbled.

"I was shit faced Thrumble, you took that seriously?"

"keep ya voice down you stupid tit, yeah serious Minty. You and I both know we need an infusion, our congregents ain't what the used to be." The voice rumbled like two rocks jostled together.

"Yeah, of course. We known that. Why the hell can't we just talk bout it at pearls?" The first voice inquired.

"Cuz we gotta break tha law?" A low gravely whisper rumbled.

"So?" The accent accented.

"Not their law, we gotta break the scroll code."

"Literally Hell no!"

"Hear me out, it is more of a circumversion of tha law. I have been talking with my brother, Verhumroro, he says that..." The grumble voice said leaning close to the other voice in the dim light. " There was a case where wajic was used to destroy a parks congregants, but the big dogs said it don't count cuz it was one towns tals dat used the wajic. Some fuckin culties got some jackass cousins diary or somethin."

"Fuck, I am not trying to get any big cousin lookin at me. Christmas has it out for me... I told him I preferred Dewa Solstice at the picnic sixty years ago."

"You gotta grow a pair Minty, else ya gonna be forgotten. Also and don't get mad, I already gave your tals some wajic scribbles."

Reed exhaled, but couldn't breath right and coughed a bit. He listened for the voices for a long time but heard only the tiny squeak of a chipmunks anus.
