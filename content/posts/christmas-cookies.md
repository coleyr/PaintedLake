Expectation is the scent of reality. Michael wouldn't say aloud that he was often hesitant to hope when the  opportunity arose, but he was. Ever since he could write he would write to santa and ask for presents, he would even underline and bold the important ones. As soon as the envelope went to the mailbox he would immediately start worrying about whether or not santa would get it.

"Do you think he loses letters?" Michael asked his mother.

"I don't think he does, it's the magic and he has elves that got through them." Judy responded while gently setting a gaudy fake house on some white fluff with little flecks of clear plastic on it. Michael was relieved for a moment, but only a moment.

"Who picks up the letters from here?" Michael posited with a renewed concern.

"The post office will take it and then hand it straight to the elves who hand it straight to santa. Would you hand me that pig?" Judy said pointing to a tiny pig wrapped in brown paper. Michael watched as judy placed the small ceramic pig on a outfrount of one of the gaudy little houses with a mirror that was supposed to look like ice. The pig sat on its haunches and snapped into position at a particular place. Judy flipped a switch and it started to rotate and glide across the small mirror. Michael almost forgot to worry about his letter.

"Do the mailman ice skate it to the eleves?" Michael said recalling his experience ice skating and how difficult he found it to stay upright. Judy thought for a moment while spreading the fluff around some little fake trees.

"No, the post office, and the elves use magic, and the letters go into a special tube that goes straight into santas workshop. Like at the bank. " Michael nodded. Then walked to the living room and reached into the couch cushion and pulled a small piece of paper. He had written a backup list, in case he needed to send another. He then starred at the squiggles but wasn't quite sure what number five on the list was, Judy had told him it was a bit like prayer you didn't have to know it all just get close, but santa needed the list and god could read your mind. Michael now had an airtight case and he knew exactly how the letters got to santa but he couldn't help but worry about the letter getting to santa.

Another especially hard thing Michael had to deal with was the wonton selection of Christmas cookies, Judy preferred to try new recipes out of her magazines. She loved the pictures and thought the smiling chefs and celebrities couldn’t possibly cook better than her, though they often could. Michael hated peppermint and cinnamon, but sometimes the recipe called for it. But upon cleaning his bathroom and drawing a particularly precious picture Michael was able to convince his mother to bake regular sensible cookies. He watched her stir in the ingredients, not looking away for a moment.

“What’s that?” Michael asked as Judy scooped some unknown powder into a little plastic spoon.

“baking powder” Judy said peering at the recipe then looking at her watch. Michael nodded permissively.

“What’s that?” Michael asked as Judy unscrewed a black bottle.

“Vanilla extract” Judy said hurriedly. Michael nodded permissively.

Judy scooped out the little balls of dough onto a cooking sheet and placed them into the oven then hurried off. Michal watched for a moment through the small window in the oven. He then sat down on the floor and waited for the cookies to be done. He sniffed the air, proper cookies he thought. Judy rushed back in and placed the cookies on the stove to cool then scampered off. Michael paced the floor in between burning his fingers. Finally it hurt just the right amount and he quickly took a big bit of cookie. Michael savored the chocolate and the gooey bits in between opening his mouth to cool his tongue. He swallowed and smacked his lips. “ahhhh” he said aloud. Then he smacked again, there was some unwelcome flavor lingering, at first masked by chocolate and heat, but there it was. Peppermint, the flavor of poison if it was maid by elves. Michael threw the hot gooey cookie mess as hard as he could and it stuck to the ceiling. He had to stay in his room the rest of the day, partly because he was so mad and partly because Judy told him so. The worst part is everyone else liked the chocolate chip cookies with mint and they became a regular Christmas staple, the only consistent Christmas cookie.
