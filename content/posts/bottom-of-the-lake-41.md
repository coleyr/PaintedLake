Harry looked up and down the alley quickly then turned back to the door and his lock picks.  They had started out early the next morning only to find the doors of the bar and also the one in the alleyway locked.  Doyle had been less than cordial when Harry had interrupted his morning tea to start the adventure but the magician had been undeterred.

"Why are we breaking in again?" Doyle asked.  He was watching one end of the alleyway while his valet watched the other.

"I want to get a look at that room again without Madame Evrelsa or her people around," Harry said.  He placed a pick back into his bag and pulled out a smaller one and began edging it into the door's lock.  "I do not know how much--"

"If anything," Doyle interrupted.

"If anything," Harry amended.  "If any of it was real.  You cannot trust a criminal mind to deal from the top, Doyle.  So I want look at that deck before deals any more cards from it."

"You think her tarot deck is a fake?"  Doyle brushed some snow off of a garbage can and sat on it.

"I am using the cards as a metaphor.  But you are correct that we should examine that as well."  Harry pulled out the pick and examined it.  He touched the flat of it to his tongue.  When Doyle raised an eyebrow he murmured, "Tasting for iron shavings.  To know where the tumblers are hitting."  He stared at the pick for a moment then put it back in the bag.  He looked at Doyle.  "This is wrong."

"Yes!" Doyle said, standing.  "Let us get breakfast and come back when they are--"

"This, however, is right," Harry said, holding up a different pick.

Doyle thumped down heavily on the garbage can again.  He looked around self-consciously then pulled out the half burned stub of a cigar and lit it.  "You abhor thievery, Harry."

"Yes," Harry said.  "Except in politicians and prostitutes.  There it is more akin to watching artists at work.  This is not thievery, Doyle, this is science.  Nothing done in the pursuit of science can be truly criminal."

Doyle's valet reached over and pointed at one of the picks.  Harry considered it then shook his head and went back to working the lock with his current one.  Doyle gave them both a dark look.

"You," he said, gesturing at Harry with his cigar, "are a fool."  He pointed at his valet.  "And what are you doing over here.  Go back to watch the other end of the alley."

"'s cold over there," the valet muttered as he trudged off.

"It's winter, you baboon get!" Doyle hissed after him.  "It is cold everywhere."

The valet made gesture over his shoulder that could be taken as either agreement or something less flattering.  Harry furtively looked up and then swapped out the pick he had been using for the one the valet had suggested.

"They know we are coming back, Doyle," Harry said, answering Doyle's unspoken question.  "But they are wrong about 'when' we are coming back."

The lock clicked and Harry stood up, smiling.  Doyle waved off his valet and stood up.  "Why do they know we are coming back?"

Harry held up the pick so that Doyle's valet could see it.  The valet nodded sheepishly then shrugged and walked off towards the car.

"What?" Harry said, packing up his things and listening at the door. "Oh, last night, I left your billfold behind so they naturally will assume you will want it back and come for it."  He smiled.  "During normal operating hours."

Doyle patted his jacket pockets suddenly then opened his mouth to yell.  Harry held up a hand to forestall his outburst.  "Politicians, prostitutes and magicians, I suppose."
