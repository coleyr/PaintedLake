"Did I ever tell you about Stagwell Meckar?" Doyle said as he waved to one of the stewards for another bourbon.

He and Harry were sitting at the Doyle's club in plush chairs near the fire.  A small cluster of empty glasses sat on the drink table next to his chair.  The steward mimed pouring a glass and pointed at Harry.  Harry shook his head.

"No, not that I recall," Harry said then he said suddenly.  "Those men are going to die, aren't they, Arthur?  The ones whose cargo we dumped into the ocean."

Doyle stared into the fire.  The steward brought Doyle's drink.  He did not clear the empty glasses from the table.  Doyle liked to mark time by the glasses.  He waited until the stewardhad retreated out of earshot.

"Stagwell, we called him 'The Stag'.  He was one of my boys.  Came in as a transfer."  Doyle settled back into the chair and propped a foot on a nearby stool.  "Yes, Harry, those smugglers will most likely be killed.  If they figure out that we dumped it into the sea they might get away with a severe beating.  They can blame it on a rival gang of smugglers.  It depends on whose cargo it was.  Sometimes only a beating for failure or maybe some of the men will die and some will not.  It is hard to know."

Harry downed his bourbon in a single swallow, grimaced, and waved for another.  The two sat silent while Harry's drink was prepared and brought over.

"You can take these, Reg," Doyle said to the steward.  "This one is my last." He held up his glass.

"Very good, sir," the steward said.

"You were in the war, Reg, yes?" Doyle asked.

The steward nodded.  Nothing in the club was off limited to members, including the pasts of the staff.

"Did you know Private, first class, Stagwell Meckar?" Doyle asked.

"I do not believe I ever made his acquaintance, sir."  Harry noted that the steward avoided making any comment on whether that was a good or bad thing.  Experienced, Harry thought.  He has dealt with officers deep in their cups before.

"Thank you, Reg," Doyle said.  The steward jumped on the opportunity to exit before Doyle could pull him into listening to a story.  Doyle was notorious for wrapping up a 'captive audience' for an hour or more sometimes.

"Drink that one slow, Harry,"  Doyle said.  He pulled off his shoe and then used his toes to pry off the shoe on the foot resting on the stool.  He swirled the golden liquid in his glass, slowly warming it.

"Stag was a coward," Doyle continued.  "Complete waste as a soldier.  The shooting would start--it never stopped actually, always a few rifles going off somewhere.  But it would start in earnest, and as sure as the sun rising, Stag would be huddled in some recess, rifle discarded in the mud, gripping his helmet.  Terrified of getting shot in the head." Doyle chuckled.  "Did you know he tried to wear two helmets once?  He would have crawled on the ground in the filth if I had left him to his druthers."

"That is a horrible story, Arthur.  Thank you for sharing," Harry said.  "I feel much better about potentially murdering those men."

Doyle scowled at him.  "There is a message in this story for you, Harry."

"Arthur, can you move straight to that?  I would like to go about getting drunk now."

"Fine.  The moral of the story is: So it did stop for a time.  Not long mind you, but we were grateful all the same."  Doyle took a sip from his glass and leaned back and closed his eyes.

The placement of the chair slightly obscured Doyle's face at that angle.  Harry squeezed his unoccupied hand in frustration.  His mind was already working on the puzzle, twisting it.  Who was grateful?  Why were they grateful?  Of what were they grateful?  Did this Stag--

Harry sighed and set his glass down on the table near his chair.  "Please continue, Arthur."

"Are you sure, Harry?"

Harry could almost feel the smile radiating off Doyle's hidden face.  He waited.  Patience was one skill few could match him in.  Eventually, Doyle sat up.  He reached over and took the glass out of Harry's hand.  "Give me that," he grumbled.  "You are about as fun as a car full of old nuns."

"Stagwell?" Harry prompted.

"Big man," Doyle said.  The 'story teller' was gone.  Now he was just reciting facts.  Harry ignored the brusque tone knowing Doyle would fall back into his story teller's mode quickly.

"Big," Doyle continued.  "When he rotated in we were all at first delighted.  A bullet will kill a big man the same as a small one, but a large presence in the trench settles the boys' nerves a bit.  That lasted about twenty minutes.  Until the first rounds began flying.  Stag pissed himself right there. Standing right there in front of the whole squad.  Then he was shoving himself into the smallest crevice he could find.  It looked like an elephant trying to fit into a mouse hole."

Doyle took a long sip of one of the bourbons he was holding.  "Everyone hates a bloody coward."

"You told me all men are cowards in war," Harry said.

Doyle stared at the two drinks he was swirling.  "Yes, I suppose I did.  Cowards.  Which is why we all hated him."  He set them down on the table.  He signaled for the steward to remove them.  Harry raised a finger when the steward grabbed his drink off Doyle's table but then lowered it.  Doyle was done drinking which meant everyone was done drinking.

They stood and headed towards the lobby.  Behind them the steward waived for the two men's coats and hats to be retrieved.
