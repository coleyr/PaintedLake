They stood and headed towards the lobby.  Behind them the steward waived for the two men's coats and hats to be retrieved.

Outside the club, Harry followed Doyle through the blisteringly cold wind.  He kept a hand on his hat to keep it from blowing off his head.  Doyle stalked more than strolled as if he was a battleship plowing through the waves intent on some target.  Eventually, Doyle led him into a small opening along the side of a crumbling stone wall.  A few teenagers lounged inside the small recess, trying to look tough and unconcerned.

"Take a walk, boys," Doyle said, gesturing toward the snow and whistling wind outside the entrance.

"Wha?" said one of the boys, standing.  "You Mary's 're bent if ya think we're giving ya this cave and goin' out there."

Harry took a step back.  There were five boys, slowly coming out of their forced languid poses now that their leader had stepped forward and set the tone.  Doyle drunk, trying to outwalk war memories, and faced with five sneering targets was a bad combination Harry had seen a number of times.

Doyle stared intently into young tough's eyes.  To his credit the boy lost his bravado but he did not back down.  Doyle looked out of the opening as if seeing the snow for the first time.  After a moment, he nodded.  "Fine.  Sit."

Harry was as shocked that the boy still had all of his teeth as the boy was that he had been so summarily dismissed.  The boy opened his mouth to speak and Harry corrected his thought to "had all of the teeth he had when he and Doyle had entered".

"You--" the boy started.

"SIT!!" Doyle roared.  Inside the small space his voice boomed and reverberated like a crack of thunder.  The five boys jumped back as one and planted themselves on the small bench near the wall they had been lounging on.  Harry had not thought the leader's mouth could have opened any wider but it had.  He looked like he was waiting for a dentist to go in with both hands to work on his yellow-stained teeth.

Doyle stepped forward and made a parting motion with his hands.  The boys traded unsure glances then their leader gestured for some of the boys to slide down.  Doyle grunted then sat down on the bench in the open space.  Harry remained standing.

Doyle took out one of his cigars and began to light it.  "I let my boys beat on Stagwell.  I hated him as much as they did.  Maybe more.  Boys do not really know how to hate until they become men."  He took a long drag and filled the small space with smoke.  Harry waved what came at him towards the door, but the boys on the did not move a muscle.  Instead they stared at Doyle with unease and awe.

"They beat Stagwell.  Tortured him in small ways.  Usually small," Doyle continued.  He stared at the ground and chewed on the cigar.  "You are so scared, Harry.  So scared.  You hide it.  Deal with it.  Cover it.  But you never showed...  Stagwell, he..."  Doyle trailed off.

For a few minutes there was only the sound of the wind screaming outside the opening.

"He what?" said the boy beside Doyle said softly.  Doyle's head snapped around, anger coloring his features, then after a moment his face softened.  He stared intently at the boy, the leader.  "He was your age, boy, I think.  Bigger than Dobbs even, Harry.  Some recruiter made a pretty penny on him to be sure."  Doyle's eyes bored into the young leader's as he spoke.  "He cried.  Sobbed all the time.  He sounded..." Doyle's voice caught slightly.  "...like...a little boy."  Doyle took another deep drag on his cigar and let the smoke curl out of his mouth.

"Horrible things," Doyle whispered.  "Did horrible things, they did.  And I let them."  Doyle leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.  "One day," Doyle slapped his hands together creating a reverberating clap.  "He stopped crying.  He stopped and stood up from the mud.  Mortars that day, I remember.  Even I was tucked into the bloody walls.  He stands up, picks up his rifle and flings it out of the trench."  Doyle made a saluting motion.  "Gives me a salute and climbs up the ladder to No Man's Land."   Doyle shook his head slightly.

"He die?" asked one of the boys.

Doyle chuckled.  "Did he ever!  Did he ever!"  Doyle stood up and began marching in place.  "I climbed up to see it.  Everyone did.  The other side opened on him.  Rifles, machine guns, everything they had.  They had their own suicides, too.  They were happy to oblige young Stagwell's request."  Doyle stopped marching in place.  "We all ducked back because bullets were flying and ricocheting.  Then it slowed and we poked our heads up.  And there is.  That big bloody bastard standing up tall, arms out even." Doyle put his arms out like he was offering a hug.  "Waiting patiently."

"Once in a while men died like that.  Standing in place, coming up the ladders in a charge.  You had to pull them down or the other side would spend the week practicing on them."  Doyle mimed raising a rifle.  He pointed it at each boy slowly, sighting down the imaginary barrel.  "When the other side fires at you, you can see the flash.  Just for an instant."  Doyle let the imaginary rifle come to a stop trained on the boy to the leader's left.  He mimed pulling the trigger then dropped his hands.

"I never wanted to be killed by a machine gun.  So plebian.  Ten off you see the same flash.  Bloody rude if you ask me.  Making a man share his last terrifying moment with someone else.  Like realizing that all of your best men at your wedding are actually marrying your bride as well that day."  Doyle turned to Harry.  "No, that did not happen to me."

One of the boys snickered.  Doyle walked back and sat down.  He took a drag on his cigar then carefully put it out and returned it to his coat pocket.  "I really do hate bourbon."

"Why drink it?" Harry asked.

"Because that is what rich bastards do!" Doyle yelled.

He settled back and looked up and down the line of boys.  "How old are you?" he asked one.

"Eighteen," the boy said, then as Doyle's scowl. "Fourteen."

Doyle scratched his chin.  "Yes, I think The Stag must have been about your age.  Someone lied to get him in.  Though we needed new bodies all the time so I doubt anyone looked hard."

"Maybe he was a criminal," said one boy.

"That's the bloody French Foreign Legion, you idiot," Doyle snapped.  "We kept all of our criminals in the British government so that we could keep an eye on them."

The leader of the boys pulled out a small flask and handed it to Doyle.  "It's not bourbon."

Doyle eyed the flask skeptically but took it.  He opened it and sniffed the contents.  His nose wrinkled but he took sip.  He grimaced.  "This is definitely not bourbon."  Then he shrugged, took a long drink, grimaced again then handed it back to the boy.  "Not bad really."  The boy smiled slighly and tucked the flask away.

Doyle started to stand.

"Wait," said one boy.  "What about Stag?"

"The Stag," Harry corrected.

"Oh," Doyle said leaning back again into the wall.  "They shot at him again.  And again.  I heard at least one machine gunner call for a reload.  Nothing.  Not even a scratch on Stagwell.  Then they stopped."

"Stopped?" said one boy incredulously.  "Stopped?"

Doyle nodded.  "Stagwell, gets tired of waiting.  Drops his jacket.  His shirt was still white, sweat stained but white.  Never took off the jacket since he arrived, I realize then.  He starts walking across No Man's Land.  And--"

"They started shooting?" said another boy.

"No, we did," Doyle said.
