Michael's dad had a habit of cycling through a set of stories from a finite repretoire. One of the regular stories whenever camping or taking vacation is mentioned was about a cold camping trip. It went like this Michael's dad and his two brothers decided to go camping on mount morrow and a storm blew in dumping snow all on the mountain side. It got so cold the brothers had to get into one sleeping bag for warmth. The telling of this story is accompanied by a generational pride and bluster and a heap of reminiscence.

Here's what confused Michael, why did his dad remember so fondly something that seemed unpleasant and forgettable. Why did that stick.

"It's for selfish reasons I assure you." Michael Said to Jay. "I want to know why I think about a trip home from piano lessons when I was twelve?" Jay put his thumb and forefinger underneath his chin in a sort of forced concentration pose. "Well I think it's kind of like Hamlet, when Hamlet puts on a play for his uncle to make him feel guilty. He saw something that was a big deal to him in the play." Jay said gesturing with his hands all the while oozing a sticky awkwardness of a theater kid always somewhat acting. "Jay, you say some insightful things. You wanna know a memory that plays in my head again and again? Something that keeps me up on nights like this?" Michael said looking up at the stars.

Jay sat up and said "Twad be an honor."

Ellory walked in the cafeteria she was wearing brown pants and a purple blouse with a brown blazer. Her tray plopped down.

"Potatoes, this meal is all potatoes. There are fries mashed potatoes and looks here a tiny piece of chicken." Ellory gestured with her fork. " I know it's not a Michelin star restaurant but c'mon we can at least get three ingredients in our meals. "

"You don't want your fries?" Michael said reaching for a crispy fry.

"Ahhh- No of course I want them! They are the only good thing in this meal." She snatched the fry and licked it.

"What makes you think that will keep your fries safe?" Michael said peering down at the crispy brown morsels.

Ellory doubled down on her strategy licking all her fries one at a time.

Michael quickly grabbed a long crispy fry and Ellory looked on her chin resting on her fist. Michael moved the fry towards his mouth. Ellory lifted and eyebrow. Michael opened his mouth to take a bite, Ellory's eyes grew wide. He crunched down and starred across the table making a show out of savoring the fry.

"Whatya think about that?" Michael said swallowing.

"Your crazy." Ellory said. " I thought they were safe, guess I will have to come up with a new strategy for keeping my food safe around you." Ellory said crossing her leg underneath the table grazing Michael's knee.

"Well it is not nothing, I think that is a very nice thing to remember." Jay said.
