In the beginning--and she knew it was cliche--Alicia Hamilton had wanted to save every kid that walked through her door.  At her small college in Missouri the faculty painted a vivid and moving picture of the role of an educator.  "Educators" made a difference, "teachers" (and she still remembered the way the word was spat out during lectures), no, "teachers" were glorified babysitters holding the next wave of worker bees up until it was their time.

"Hey, Teach," Rodney XXXX said walking through the hallway door.

Yes, in the beginning, Alicia had wanted to save every kid, but after two or three "Rodneys" a year sleeping walking through her classes she was content if they did not stab their eye out with a pencil (accidentally or otherwise).

"Rodney?" she asked.  "What brings you in during my lunch break?"

"Glad you said that, Teach."  Rodney put an apple he had been eating between his teeth and began thrashing his hand around inside his backpack.  "MMad mm mppl mur mu."

They had not taught FullMouth Speak at her small college either but Alicia had picked it up in her first year.  "You have an apple for me, Rodney?"

Rodney was still thrashing.  "Mmmhmmm.  Mum mv me mm mu."  Frustrated, Rodney upended his book bag on Alicia's desk, spilling out papers, books and other boy-related knic-nacks.

Alicia shot a look at the clock, watching it tick her precious private time away.  "From your mother, Rodney?"

He pulled the apple out of his mouth.  "Lost it, I guess.  Mom's gonna be P.O.ed.  She said you have been single so long that anything hard would get me a good grade.  Actually, maybe that was dad."  Rodney shrugged, put the apple back in his mouth, and began shoving his stuff back into his backpack.

"MM mot mmpfng mor mu," Rodney said.  Alicia made a mental note to spill something extremely cold or extremely hot into Rodney's dad's lap at the next parent teacher conference.

"What would that be, Rodney?"  Rodney produced a crumpled piece of paper out of one pocket, unrolled it and handed it to her.  He set the apple down on the edge of her desk.

Alicia took the page and smoothed it out.  "Math homework," she said.  "Excellent!"  She tried to shove every ounce of cheer she could manage into her voice.  Rodney turning in homework, even math homework to a biology teacher, was grounds for celebration.

Rodney beamed.  "Daniel checked the whole thing.  Twice!"  Rodney shot a quick but obvious glance at the red marker she used for grading.  "You can check it now if you want."

"Daniel only checked it...?" Alicia probed.  She waited patiently for Rodney to catch up.

"What? Oh yeah.  It's not his work.  I would never pay my best friend.  I got people for that.  He just wants to check their work."  Rodney winked, clearly missing his own admission of plagiarizing.

Rodney looked down at the half eaten apple on the desk.  "Hey, you already got one.  Are you..."

Alicia shook her head.  "Please, Rodney, you have it."  He had it scooped up before the sentence was completely out of her mouth.  She scanned over the paper and noted it looked about 75% correct.  If Ms. Creswell graded it fairly Rodney (and his mystery homework provider) would be happy.

She noticed something scrawled at the bottom of the page.  "Boyfriend, first traffic cop (yes/no?), neighbor?" she read.  She raised an eyebrow.

"Whoops!" Rodney said, smiling.  He snatched the page, reread the scribbling and then tore out the section of paper that contained it.  Alicia noticed that about 2/3 of the page was left.  Ms. Creswell had little tolerance for ripped papers.  Alicia sighed inwardly, oddly sad that Rodney's parents' hard earned money would go to waste.

"For the Murder Club," Rodney said, shoving the torn slip back into his pocket.  "Mr. S's club.  We figure out who killed people in crime cases."

Alicia nodded.  "I remember.  Your after school forensics club."  She could see Rodney processing the bigger word, searching through his teen-addled memory for it.  Finally, he smiled and nodded.

"Okay, gotta go, Teach.  Thanks for the apple."  At the door, Rodney stopped.  "Don't worry, Ms. H," he said in a serious tone.  "Once you get preggers your knockers will blow up like watermelons.  Then you can get a date."

Alicia somehow managed to yank the corners of her mouth into something resembling an appreciative smile.  "Thank you, Rodney.  I cannot tell you how relieved that makes me."  She waived the torn, crumpled paper at him.  "Thank you for this also.  I will make sure it gets to the right teacher."

Rodney gave her a thumbs up and stepped back into the hallway.

"He did not stab himself through the eye," she said to herself a few times like a mantra.  It was, all in all, a successful morning.
