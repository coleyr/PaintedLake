"Michelle, do you ever do things just because they are the right thing to do?" There was a rustling in the crate a few yards down from TJ then Michelle poked her head out.  "Well, you certainly can't do the 'left' thing, can you Tripod?"

TJ stared, his jaw working while he considered her response.  After a minute he scowled.  "That was a joke?"

Michelle ducked back into the crate she was searching.  "You are brighter than you look, TJ.  Eventually."

TJ pried open another crate with his crowbar,  this one with a bit more force than necessary.  They searched in silence for a while then Michelle climbed out of her crate.  "Was that a real question, Tripod?"

TJ looked over.  He stared for a full minute processing.  Michelle had realized that while he could move like lightning physically, TJ's mental leaps took a bit more backing up to hit a full run.  She waited.

"You mean about doing the right thing?"  TJ shoved the contents of the crate back into it and wrestled the lid back into place.  Michelle decided against commenting on the amount of time it took him to connect the dots--man with short temper, large crowbar was a bad combination in confined spaces.  Instead she nodded.

"Hand me those nails," TJ said.  He pointed to a few that had rolled near where she was standing in his overzealous opening earlier.  "Yes, about doing the ri--the correct thing."

Michelle's lips quirked into a half smile.  "Touché."  She scooped the nails and tossed them over.  TJ caught them against his body and let them fall into his free hand.  Michelle reached into one of the haphazardly opened crates they were still searching and pulled out a bottle of water.  She sat on the ground with her back against the crate.  They were in the warehouse of the local water botting company.  Crates, presumably full of bottled water, were lined up in neat rows by the hundreds.

Michelle looked at the bottle's label.  It showed a picture of the town square.  She recognized old Minty Nose's statue and smiled.  The label was computer drawn, lots of little dots, but she felt like she could almost see the tiny break in the statue's nose that her gum was still apparently holding in place years later.

"No," she said simply.  "I don't ever do the right thing so the question is irrelevant.  My turn."  She took a deep breath.  "Did you kill Sarah, TJ?"

TJ stared at her but not with the look he usually got that indicated he was doing Herculean mental calculations.  He looked...guilty.

"No,"

"But..." Michelle prompted.

"But I wanted her to die," TJ said.  "She was doing it with a teacher."  TJ swung the crowbar like a baseball batter taking a practice swing.  "Did you know that?"

Michelle shrugged.  "Sarah never said as much, but I, I had my suspicions.  She seemed so happy all of a sudden."

TJ stared at her and there was the slightest tinge of menace in his gaze.  She held up her free hand, palm out in surrender.  "Let me finish, Tripod."  For some reason hearing her insult him calmed him slightly.  He lowered the crowbar but did not put it down.

"She," Michelle took a swallow of water, "was really concerned with 'adult' stuff.  Ever since we were kids--like little kids--she wanted to grow up, have a husband, and a dog."

"A dog?" TJ walked over to another crate.  "She never mentioned dogs to me once."

"Maybe it was a baby, who cares.  You get my point?" TJ nodded.

Michelle grabbed a water and tossed it to TJ.  He caught it  in the hand holding the nails.  Why are the lights on anyways, she thought.  The company always kept the fluorescents on in the warehouse.  Supposedly it was to stop theft because you could see inside and spot thieves.  There were no windows, though, which limited the company's plan somewhat.  Also who bothered stealing water?  But the more Michelle dug into and saw--really saw--the town she lived in the more oddities she found.  The kind everyone knows about but never thinks to put all together to see the pattern.

TJ was still waiting for her answer so she dismissed the lights from her mind and continued.  "Around middle school, when we found out about sex Sarah got really depressed."

"You learned about sex in middle school?" TJ asked, astonished.

"No, Tripod, we asked about the birds and bees in science class and someone let slip that it was a metaphor for sexual intercourse," Michelle said.

"Really?" TJ said.  "That's--"

Michelle rolled her eyes.  "No, doofus, we learned about it in freshman year along with everyone else.  But we started talking about it in middle school.  It was like a sign of being grown up we thought."  She drained the last of her water bottle and tossed it back into the crate.  "Wait when did you learn about sex?  In fr--"

"Way earlier!" TJ said quickly.  "Like middle school.  No before.  Like elementary school.  Early elementary school.  Yeah, we all, all the guys talked about it.  All the time.  I talked about it all the time."

Michelle let him ramble until he sputtered out weakly with "so I knew about it really early..."

"Great.  You are a healthy American boy," she said.  "Back to the bedtime story you asked me for.  So Sarah got depressed.  Who wants some stupid guy to pee inside your vagina?"  Michelle held up a hand to forestall TJ's comment.  "I know, but when you're a newly minted middle schooler and an 8th grader in all her wisdom tells you something you listen."

"I never peed on Sarah," TJ said quickly.  "She didn't ask--do you think--"

"No," Michelle said and tried to keep hey eye roll from sending her into stroke territory. How has the human race survived this long with half the population complete morons, she thought.  "No, we knew by 7th or 8th grade that urine had nothing to do with making babies.  So I doubt our mystery Romeo was...look, moving along, so Sarah got depressed.  Like curl up on the bathroom floor and listen to U2 depressed.  Husband was a checkbox, like baby, dog, etc."

TJ walked over and sat next to her, leaning against the box.  He reached over his head and grabbed two more water bottles.  He offer one to Michelle.

"She never connected kids and husband to 'guy?" TJ asked, but it was not really a question.  "So why date me?  Or any of us.  There were like 3 guys before me."

"Eight, actually," Michelle said.  TJ gave her a sidelong glance.  "But most of those just peed in her," Michelle said and then counted in her head.

"You're joking around," TJ said. Fifteen seconds , Michelle thought. Our little knuckle dragger is getting faster. "Two before you.  Doland Duck and Jimmy Garrano," Michelle said.  "The third was Reggie--"

"Big Reggie or Little Reggie?" TJ said.

"Little," Michelle said.  "I think," she added after a moment.  "No, Big.  They did closet time once for about 30 seconds."

"That's right, 'The Biter'," TJ chuckled.

Michelle finished her water and stood up.  She chucked it into the open crate.  "Hey, don't laugh.  We hear all kinds of stupid stuff in middle school.  Sarah really thought 'light nibbles on the neck' was a thing.  Be glad you were past the learning years."

TJ got up and stretched his back.  "Reggie looked like a vampire almost got him."  His smile faded.  "So I was a boy and she wanted a man?  That type of thing?"

Michelle pointed to a sealed crate and nodded.  "Something like that."

TJ placed the edge of the crowbar against the lip of the new crate's lid.  "Thanks for being honest with me, Second Place."  There was no bite in TJ;s nickname for her when he said it this time.  "You're not so bad sometimes."

TJ looked down at the crate and then the crowbar.  He pulled it out and peered at the tip.

"What?" Michelle asked.  She had started to move towards another opened crate but paused.

"Did you hear that popping sound?" TJ asked.  Michelle looked around, listening intently.  The giant warehouse was lit up but silent.  She shook her head.  Had someone gotten in through the single door in the far wall without them hearing it.  She looked and saw that the bar they put to lock the doors from the inside was still there.

"Maybe someone was inside before we got here?  In one of the crates?  Or creeping around?" she edged down and picked up the second crowbar TJ had brought with him.

TJ put the tip of his own crowbar back into the lip of the crate's lid.  "No way.  We would have heard them by now.  It's been hours."

"Okay," Michelle said.  She did not sound convinced.

TJ chuckled.  "Creep."  Michelle raised an eyebrow.  "Sarah, always saying that, remember.  This guy was a creep, that guy a creep.  Like she was upset about the whole world being in love with her.  Like who could help it?  I mean look at her she was perfect.  But it pissed her off all the same."  TJ worked while he talked, grunting and looking for the most ideal leverage.  Michelle continued to scan the other cartons and the rest of the warehouse.

"Creep.  That was her favorite word some days," TJ went on.  "And you know--here stand back, this one was tougher than the rest--you know sometimes she could be a real royal class bitch."  TJ looked up. "Weird, that popping sound again.  Maybe it's my shoulder since I'm the only one working here.  Did I tell you my dad wants to get me sports injury insurance?  What is that even--hey, you okay, Second?"

Michelle stopped her scanning.  "Sorry, TJ.  Spidey-senses and all that.  Come on let's finish this.  Finish opening that crate.  That will take us down to 1 million left to search for something we have no clue what we are looking for."

TJ pushed and the crate lid started to come, but then there was a large cracking sound and it split in half.  The non-nailed piece clattered as it hit the floor.  TJ cursed he reached down to grab the broken piece when he heard Michelle's sharp intake of breath.  He stood up, broken wood forgotten.  Michelle was staring into the crate with her jaw open.

TJ was silent for a moment.  "Looks like we need to open 1 million more crates tonight," he said.
