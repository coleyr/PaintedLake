The water tour was everything Stacy and the class had expected it to be: monotonous and filled with trips to the bathroom.  Apparently, it was proper to indulge in whatever a factory produced while on tour.  The students' $10 tour fee covered a lunch and bottled water, lots and lots of bottled water.

"And this, kids, is where we make the water," Elmer Duck (pronounced Duke) said waving an arm at a giant machine.  Workers were turning various knobs and checking dials and pressure gages.

"Is it safe to be in here, Mr. Duck?" Stacy asked.  The machine was deafening and looked a fairly long in the tooth.  Rust colored much of the giant pipes feeding into and out of the machine.  Elmer Duck (pronounced Duke) peered down at her.

"Safe?" he cackled.  "You want to see the safe?  There is nothing in there, girlie.  Let me tell you."  Ms. Miss leaned in and shouted something in Elmer's ear.  A look of comprehension slowly, very slowly, appeared on his face.  Stacy noticed that Ms. Miss's hand remained on Elmer's shoulder.  She looked over to see Michelle smirking at her.  Stacy smiled uncomfortably.  Michelle's smirk was a cross between a lion getting ready to eat you and a lion who had eaten you.  Or maybe it was just the blinking red light on Michelle's teeth that made--

Stacy looked closer at Michelle's mouth then up at the ceiling.  There was a red light bulb flashing.  There was a faded sign next to it that was peeling off the wall around its edges. Caution , it read and then something else illegible.  She wracked her brain trying to remember what the safety briefing Elmer had given them said, but she could not recall anything about flashing red lights.  Now that she thought about it the safety presentation had been a tour of the Wall of Ducks (pronounced Dukes) that showed every Duck over the last 100+ years who had been CEO of the water company.  The entire safety presentation Elmer had given was about always watching where you stepped lest you break a leg like everyone one the Wall of Ducks (including Elmer Duck--pronounced Duke--who walked with a limp and a cane).

Stacy tried to point at the light and show Michelle but the other girl ignored her and turned her gaze back onto Ms. Miss.  The light was flashing fast now.  Stacy had to do something, tell someone who would do something.  She began threading her way forward through the throng of students and chaperones.  After a moment of pushing and sliding past people she made it to bottom of the rickety steps leading up to the platform in front of the machine.  She could hear Elmer better up here.

"Mr. Duke," she said, waving her arms.  He kept speaking for a few more seconds then turned and gave Ms. Miss a quizzical look.  The teacher mouthed "What?" to Stacy and the pointed off to where the bathrooms were located.

Stacy shook her head and pointed up at the blinking red light.  Most of the boys were punching each other in the arms outside of the view of the chaperones.  The girls were clustered in groups most likely talking about nothing related to the giant machine in front of them or the water bottling factory.  She pointed more urgently at the light.  Mr. Elmer was now also mouthing "What?" and pointing towards the bathroom.  Every few points he would stop and ask Ms. Miss something who shrugged.  The light seemed to be blinking faster.  Stacy began to panic.  Then Sarah was there in front of her pointing up at the blinking red light.  All eyes followed her finger to the ceiling.

And then pandemonium broke loose.

Kids scattered, knocking into each other.  Chaperons grabbed kids and tried to drag them away. One or two just pushed kids out of their way and ran, maybe hoping that the kids would follow on their own,  Stacy was not sure.  Elmer yelled a high pitched screech which caused Ms. Miss to slam her hands over her ears.  He stood paralyzed.  Everyone else was running everywhere and suddenly Sarah was yanked back from the foot of the platform.  Stacy looked back in time to see Michelle half pulling, half shoving Sarah towards one of the doorways, Beatrice trailing in their wake.

The scene was chaos because everyone was moving at once trying to get towards the single exit.  The emergency exit door was blocked by several pallets of bottled water.  Stacy frantically looked around until unbelievably her gaze fell on a large switch with Emergency Shut Off printed in large faded letters below it.  There were other words written below those but the peeling paper made them hard to see.

Before she realized what she was doing, Stacy ran up the steps, shoved Elmer out of the way and grabbed the switch that he had been casually wresting his elbow on only minutes ago.  She pulled with all of her strength.  It did not budge.  Stacy pulled again and looked up at Elmer, trying to get his attention.  He looked down at her but stayed frozen in place.  Frustrated she began yanking on the switch until finally she placed one foot against the side of the machine and heaved with all of her might.

The switch flipped down and Stacy went flying.  The machine suddenly feel completely silent.  People stopped, taken off guard by the silence.  A low rumble started.  It seems to travel up the machine and then as it made its way towards the pipe turned into a gurgling sound.  Stacy, along with everyone else, followed the sound with her eyes.  Suddenly, a flap in the pipe above Stacy's head opened up.  Stacy had enough time to think I am going to die.  It's steam! before giant stream of water came gushing out of the flap and slammed into her.

The force of it knocked Stacy down the steps of the platform and back ten feet.  She rolled another two or three feet coming to a stop in front of a crowd of students and chaperones.  Stacy was drenched and dazed.  She shook her head a few times.

"What is that ungodly stench?" Sarah said.  Stacy realized she had been throw halfway across the shop floor and landed directly at Michelle and Sarah's feet.  Something shifted under Stacy: Beatrice.  Stacy must have rolled into her and knocked her down.

"Get off me!" Beatrice yelled.

"What is that ungodly stench?" Sarah said again.

"It smells like" Michelle wrinkled her nose, "sewage."  Sarah covered her dainty nose and took a few steps back.  The next few seconds happened in slow motion.  Stacy felt Beatrice shove her hard from below.  Stacy looked down to see the Beatrice was staring horrified at Sarah's look of disgust.  Then Stacy saw a small smirk creep over Michelle's face.  A killer's smile devoid of any emotion. No! Stacy thought frantically.

"Look, it's Backwater Betty and Stinky Stacy," Michelle said.

Around her, kids, adults, even her teacher busted out laughing.  She could see Elmer, now leaning on the switch for balance while he doubled over with laughter.  Stacy looked down and recoiled.  In Backwater Betty's eyes was a look of hatred so intense that Stacy knew she would never ever let herself get caught alone with her. No, Stacy thought. Stinky Stacy.  Stinky Stacy can never be alone with Backwater Betty again. The look in Betty's eyes though indicated that maybe even having other people around would not be enough to keep her safe. --------------------------- Stacy had been in the lunch line, her classmates keeping the cruel six foot distance from her.  She did not stink.  Stinky Stacy washed herself more often and more vigorously, almost to the point of scrapping off skin.  But it did not help.  Shame smelled as bad as dirt and could not just be washed away with a little soap and water.  Stacy told herself she did not notice how far everyone kept from her, even the adults.  Paying for her lunch was maddening.  She usually had to practically throw her money to the lunch lady behind the cash register.  Otherwise the lunch lady would go on break with a 'leave it on the counter, dear' tossed back over her shoulder.

Stacy trudged out of the lunch line and into the cafeteria to look for a seat.  The only good thing about being stinky was that you could have any seat you wanted.  Entire tables would clear as soon as she sat down. Surrounding tables, too.  But Stink Stacy did not like seeing people get up and leave their lunches on her account.  She had done a lot of reading about health over the last two years, specially healthy foods, specially foods that did or did not cause a person to smell bad.  She had sworn off garlic, though she did not care for that anyways.  But a few of the other foods she missed.  It was important to eat so she stayed along the walls with the other derelicts, six feet from the other derelicts.

"Stop woolgathering," someone said.  She looked up just in time to see Backwater Betty, the usual look of hatred, in her path.

"I--" Stacy started

Then she tripped.  Her shoe lace she realized belatedly, she had noticed it in line and meant to tie it.  Stacy fell forward, hitting her elbow hard, which made her cry out.  Somehow she ended up on her back.  Her tray of food was in the air, just completing the arc up, and now beginning to descend fast, toward her face.  The tray struck her on the forehead but it was plastic so it only stung a little.  The silverware missed her thankfully, but the food, of course, was not as considerate.  Mashed potatoes slammed into her hair, carrots landed on her chest and her bowl of soup came down upright, but then hit her chin and flipped over, coating her neck in lukewarm beef stew.

"Klutz!" Backwater Betty laughed.  It was a harsh laugh with no humor in it. Never alone with her , Stacy thought automatically.  Everyone in the cafeteria laughed also though Stacy thought she heard genuine humor in most of their voices.  She sighed and rolled over to get up then stopped.  Under her face was a pair converse.  Stacy recognized those converse and the legs sprouting out of them.  Michelle...

Stacy rolled back onto her back.  Michelle stared down at her, that look in her eyes, like she was flipping through a rolodex of horrible nicknames looking for juuuust the right one for the situation. I hope it's not Stinky Carrot Stacy, Stacy thought, realizing that one was now jabbing her in the back. I like carrots .

Backwater Betty stepped forward to stare down at her as well.  She was looking down at Stacy and then over at Michelle with a gleeful look.

Michelle's lips parted and Stacy waited for her sentencing for her klutziness. --------------------------- It was almost too easy.  So easy that maybe she should have passed it up.  Stinky Stacy covered in carrots and soup, sprawled on the floor.  Stacy's best friend, Betty was there too.  Or  maybe they were bitter enemies.

The name came to Michelle in a flash.  Some days were just perfect.  It laid everything out for you so that all you had to do was--

Michelle paused.  Her mouth was half open, the new name, a masterpiece of a name, on the tip of her tongue.  She paused, noting that the cafeteria had grown silent.  The pause would only make it more dramatic.  Give this masterpiece the dramatic entrance into the world that it deserved.  She started again--

Michelle looked at Stacy, really looked at her.  The girl, covered in whatever the lunch ladies were trying to pass off as stew today, vegetables scattered all around her.  She sat patiently, waiting for Michelle to drop the hammer. What is wrong with me, Michelle thought.  She meant What is taking me so long? but it morphed into something else.  Something that had been gnawing at the back of her mind recently. What have I become? she thought.

Michelle bit her lower lip, forcing, literally forcing the words she had loaded, loacked and ready to fire back into her throat.  It felt like swallowing bile.  The sensation gave her added strength.  Everyone was watching her, waiting. Center stage is Ra's game, not mine. The name almost came tumbling out, but she bit it back.  It was like a coiled snake, trying to blast through her teeth and get out.

Michelle extended a hand to Stacy.  "Come on, Stace.  Let's get you cleaned up."  Stacy looked up at her.  She looked at Michelle's outstretched hand, then at Michelle's mouth.  She didn't take her Michelle's hand.  Instead a wary look came over her features.  Michelle pushed her hand closer.

"Come on, Stace.  Let's go."

Slowly, tentatively, Stacy reached up and took Michelle's hand.  She gripped it lightly at first then stronger once she saw that Michelle wasn't going to snatch it back.  Stacy watched Michelle's eyes carefully as Michelle pulled her up.  She was waiting for Michelle to suddenly release her grip and drop Stacy flat on her butt.  For some reason, that was like a punch into Michelle's heart.  Once Stacy was standing, Michelle turned towards the bathrooms.  She grabbed her book bag.

"That's it?!!" Backwater Betty screeched.  "That's it?!"

Michelle spun on her heel.  "Shut up, Bac--"  She stopped.  "Shut up, Beatrice."  Beatrice reeled backwards like Michelle had struck her, then slowly collapsed onto her knees.  She sighed heavily.  "Beatrice," she said.  A small tear rolled down her cheek.

Another pain hit Michelle like a punch to the heart.  She vaguely recognized the feeling: guilt.  It felt weird, though oddly familiar.  Like riding a bike after you had been off one for a while.

Michelle grabbed Stacey's wrist and pulled her a few steps forward.  Stacy allowed herself to be led for a few feet then Michelle felt Stacy begin walking with more purpose.

"Beatrice?" one of the boys asked as she and Stacy walked by.

Michelle whirled on him.  "You got a problem with that, tit rat?"  The boy shuttered and stepped back, raising his hands in supplication.  For some reason that pissed Michelle off even more.  She stormed out of the cafeteria towards the bathrooms, Stacey following then after a few more feet, walking beside Michelle. What the Hell? Michelle thought again.
