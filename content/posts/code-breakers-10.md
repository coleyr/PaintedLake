Calowyn surveyed the dark room trying to make out an empty chair through the sea of heads in front of her.  After a few seconds of searching she gave up and looked for an empty spot along the wall that would leave an acceptable amount of space between her the listeners to either side of her.  She moved to a spot between a large man, maybe a Cascaian (it was hard to tell in the dark) and what appeared to be a female Nova.  The woman stepped minutely away from Calowyn, but the large man actually moved an inch or two into her space.  She ignored him and nodded politely to the woman for the courtesy.  When the woman returned her nod politely, Calowyn discarded the Nova theory.  "Polite" and "Nova" were words seldom used in the same sentence.  She nodded back and turned her attention to the speaker at the lectern.

"--do not know for certain," he was saying.  "But we believe, the manuscripts are legitimate based on this."  The man had a subtle theatricality to his movements Calowyn noticed.  He gestured and behind him the hologram of a manuscript appeared.  The hologram expanded until a small stain was prominently displayed.  "This watermark," he continued, "previously unnoticed until--well, until I spilled my coffee on the manuscript, revealing it."  A smattering of people laughed politely around the hall.

"There is some truth to that actually."  The man took a sip of water from a cup on the lectern. "My colleagues and I used the wrong reagent."  He gestured sheepishly.  More polite laughter from the audience.  The man next to Calowyn shook his head slightly, but she could not tell if it was in humor or from disgust.  "We spent the better part of a week analyzing the potential damage and preparing a report explaining our error and subsequent plans to rectify it.  It was not until we began the analysis on this relatively unimportant section of the manuscript that we found this."

The hologram shifted slightly and the stain swirled until it resolved itself into a circular pattern.  It was incomplete but there was no mistaking that it was a partial finger print.  Calowyn, like a few others in the crowd, raised her phone and snapped a quick picture of it.  The original would be virtually available after the lecture but old habits died slowly and having information and being able to verify it independently was a part of Calowyn's core training.

The man beside her grunted. "I will believe it when I see it."

Calowyn nodded politely without taking her eyes from the speaker at the lectern.  "How?

The man looked over.  "What?"

"How will you?" Calowyn said.

"How will I what?  How will I see it?  Why--"   Around them people shushed the man, a few with less than cordial hand gestures.  No one lifted their mask but the implication was there.

Calowyn ignored the man and stepped away from the wall.  She headed towards the nearest side aisle that led down to the stage.  Behind her, the man on the wall was arguing with someone.  A few voices were raising.  The noise had not reached the front of the auditorium yet but was getting louder.

"Sir," she said as she approached an usher standing near a door.  "That man back there along the wall.  The one arguing.  He is about to start a fight."

The usher spoke quickly into a walkie-talkie and moved off towards the commotion.  Calowyn watched him go then unobtrusively opened the door he had been standing in front of and stepped through it into the backstage area.

Ask a blowhard a nonsense question, leave abruptly, and let the sparks fly.  God, it felt good to be in the field again.  As she quietly closed the door she immediately began cataloguing her surroundings.  No one was nearby.  She considered switching her mask from the casual one she had worn to her military issue one in case she ran into another usher, but discarded the idea.  She was not in her world any longer.  Academia and academics did not take kindly to intrusions by nosy, lowly government researchers no matter how many science chits they had stitched on their temples.  Like any subculture it was invitation only.

Calowyn saw a small receptacle a few feet away, probably a prop closet, and stepped into it.  Now to wait for the good doctor to pass by so she could make her introduction, off the books.
