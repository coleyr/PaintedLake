There were certain constants in the town.

The fountain that fed the water industry just up and moved periodically.  No one knew why but at least once a generation the water bottling industry had to send out a Duck (pronounced "Duke") to find it by tripping over the fountain and breaking their leg.  It had appeared in a number of locations including--during one particularly odd decade--a brothel.  It had taken a while for the Duck family to find that one since at that time the only male Duck was the Reverend Josiah Duck.  And as he was like to announce from the pulpit every Sunday "the Reverend Josiah Duck did not take up with whores and miscreants lightly".
