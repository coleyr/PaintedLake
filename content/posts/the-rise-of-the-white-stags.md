"What!?" Harry said.  "You shot at your own man?"

"Not me specifically," Doyle grumbled.  "The boys did.  Up and down the line the boys did.  Everyone hated him, Harry.  Incessant crying.  What if he came back down the ladder?"

Harry crossed his arms.  "You let your men kill one of their own so that he--"

"He was killing us!" Doyle screamed.  "Bloody killing us, Harry!  He sounded like...he sounded like...like everything that was good dying.  Everyone shooting at him.  Them, my boys, men up and down the trench lines, both sides."  Doyle took a deep breath.  "Nothing.  Not a scratch.  He walked to some scraggly tree, sat down against it and died on his own, without all of our help."

"Just like that?" asked a boy.  "He died?  Without a bullet in him?"

"Yes," Doyle said simply.  Everyone waited, but he was silent.

"How do you know it weren't a bullet?" asked the leader of the boys.  "You were far off."

Doyle shrugged.  "Because I searched him from head to toe."

"They let you retrieve his body?" Harry asked.  He had his head cocked slightly to the side.  Nothing Doyle had ever said about his experiences in the War spoke of even basic civility.

Doyle shrugged.  "Eventually, everyone stopped shooting.  He was mine, sort of, so I raised the white flag and went out to check Stagwell for holes.  One of the German officers did the same.  We met at Stagwell's body.  Stripped him completely while the whole world waited."

"And?" Harry prompted.

"And he was untouched.  Not a scratch," Doyle shifted uncomfortably.  "Other than what my boys did to him before he went up that ladder.  But that was only some bruising."

"Was it your German?" Harry asked.

"Yes," Doyle said.  "He helped me bury Stagwell by the tree.  We put the truce flags on top of the grave to mark it."

Doyle lapsed into silence again, then said, "Stag's Road we called that place.  The Germans had a name, too, but I cannot recall it.  No one shot into that place." Doyle chuckled softly.  "No one shot anywhere for a few days.  See, we both used up most of our munitions trying to kill that bloody bastard.  So up and down the lines for a couple thousand yards, none of the officers put in supply requisitions.  We just stopped. Stopped fighting."

"You could have been overrun," said one boy.  The others nodded solemnly.

Doyle looked up and down the line.  "Your fathers were in the War?"  The boys all nodded.  "Came back?"

The boys traded uncomfortable glances then looked at their feet.

"Most of them," said the boy's leader.  "Not the same, though."

Doyle scanned the little cave's ceiling and nodded slightly.  "Yes, that is true for a lot of men."

"How long did the fighting stop?" Harry asked.

"Three days.  Three days and four nights.  Third day, I met with the Germans and told them someone had noticed a thousand Brits and Scots missing from the War and came to see what was happening.  Similar story with them, though, they were low on everything then so it took them an extra day to get munitions.  We gave them until noon to get restocked then got back to killing each other."

"The War stopped for three and a half days?" Harry asked.

"Not all of it," Doyle said.  "Just a small piece of it."  He pointed a finger at Harry.  "Men die.  Sometimes good men, most times not good men.  Good things come without warning.  A flower pops up on a battlefield.  No one knows why.  We did good tonight, Harry.  In spite of what happens to a few bad men, we did good."

Doyle stood and removed his jacket.  He turned to the boys and began rolling up his sleeves.  "Now, how about I teach you how to actually defend this little refuge from Hell."  The boys looked at each other, then slowly stood up.  Doyle waved two of the boys over and indicated the rest to step back and make room.

"Right.  Now we will go slowly, gentlemen, to preserve your ugly little visages.  If anyone takes a real swing you will feel the back of my hand so go bloody slow. When your mothers come to me in the night I want it to be for the right reasons and not to cut my throat while I sleep."  Doyle corrected one boy's foot placement.  "You, hands up, no not like that.  Keep one up like this to protect your head, good, elbow out to catch an overhand.  Good.  Now, this one is for your body..."

Harry sat down on the bench and leaned back and closed his eyes.  There was a loud slap but he ignored it.

"I said to bloody go slowly.  Save your savagery for the enemy," Doyle growled.  "Now, come in slow, slower, turn your fist slightly.  Good.  Straight wrist.  Good.  Right, next two men up.  Stances, fists up.  Good."  Slap.  "I said bloody slowly.  Tuck your chin there.  Left foot forward on the jab.  Your other left foot, idiot! Good! Now, I want you to..."
