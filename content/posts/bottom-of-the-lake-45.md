"No.  Absolutely no," Dobbs said. "No."

Harry ran a hand through his hair.  A few feet away Doyle paced, his hands thrust angrily in his pockets.

"A big, strong man like you afraid of a little camera?" Velrsa said.  "Tsk, tsk."  She patted  Dobbs' hand.

She was sitting at the seance table with the rest of her "valets", eating breakfast.  In the center of the table the camera sat, partially disassembled.  Dobbs stared warily at it while he ate.  He gestured at it with his fork.

"That thing.  No, I'll not have it stealin' me soul.  Dress it up 'ow you like, Mr. Harry, but it's evil."  He made a warding gesture at the camera.

The ladies had offered Harry and Doyle food also, but they declined, wanting to get the photo taking experiment over as quickly as possible.  Dobbs was eating Harry's portion having finished his own and Doyle's a few minutes before.

Dobbs continued.  "In the village where I grew up, I heard stories--"

"About this camera?" asked Harry, dubiously.

"You grew up in Brooklyn, you ninny," Doyle said.  He had crumpled his hat in his hands until it was bent unrecognizably.

"It's like a village," Dobbs said defensively.  He winked at one of the valets as she scooped another helping of eggs onto his plate.

"We need a test subject to set the baseline, Mr. Dobbs" Harry said.  "Madame Velrsa has graciously allowed us 10 pictures."

"You consider that price gracious," Doyle muttered.

"Ten pictures," Harry continued, ignoring Doyle.  "Doyle was in the War, he has killed people which Velrsa says tears holes in the soul.  You were not in the War so...wait have you killed anyone?"

Dobbs looked around the room, which had grown suddenly silent.  "No?" he said after a moment.  The others in the room exchanged uncomfortable glances.  "No," Dobbs said with more conviction.  "Took a few lads close but they were all alive when I walked away."

"Wait," Harry said.  "Madame, what if Dobbs had killed someone but he did not consider it wrong?"

Velrsa considered for a few moments.  "A mercy killing, you mean to say?"

"I told you I ne'er killed no one!" Dobbs protested.  Harry waved a hand to quiet him.

"If," Velrsa said slowly, "if...yes, if Mr. Dobbs did not feel the killing was wrong then his soul might not be torn."

"Good and evil are not subjective," Doyle roared.  "Harry, did we come to take this picture or not?"

"I will not be taken in again by some charlatan!" Harry bellowed back.

"She is dead, Harry," Doyle growled.  "Dead.  Let it go!"

The room was silent.

"So," Dobbs said, pointing a fork at Doyle.  "Then 'is soul might be in one piece, too?"

Doyle turned away and looked out the window.  Night was coming on and twilight bathed the room in soft light.

"Just take the bloody picture, Harry," Doyle said softly.  "Dobbs is too stupid to know right from wrong and I, I am not stupid enough."

Harry pulled his jacket off angrily and made to throw it then stopped and draped it neatly over one of the chairs.

"No one is ever gone until they are forgotten," Harry said to Doyle.  "My daughter is not forgotten.  And neither is your wife."
