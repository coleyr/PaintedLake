Harry stared hard at the woman in the velvet dress, sizing her up.  Doyle stepped forward and gave a sweeping bow then came up in a fluid motion that caught her hand and kissed it.  The woman seemed slightly taken aback.  Harry had seen the move a hundred times before and even watched as Doyle practice it for hours with Bess, getting every nuance perfect.

"Gentlemen," the valets said in unison.  They began to speak with their words overlapping.

"We are--"

"--to begin--"

"--soon."

"If you--"

"--would be--"

"--so kind--"

"--please--"

"--to take your--"

"--seats."  They finished together.  The valets gestured towards the large, circular tables where Harry noticed name cards had been placed in front of each chair.  A few of the patrons clapped politely and the gaunt woman swept forward around Harry and Doyle to a large-backed chair with a crystal ball in front of it.  Her valets pulled out her chair so that she could sit.

Harry looked at Doyle and rolled his eyes.  "Everyone is a showman these days," he said.

"Yes," Doyle smiled wryly.  "And we are all the worse for it, wouldn't you say?"  He pulled out a chair and sat.  Harry joined him in an adjacent chair, sweeping his foot casually under the table and finding the wire he knew would be there.  He smile over at the gaunt woman as he ran his finger under the lip of the table finding the break in the table he also expected.  Harry pulled out a few bills out of his pocket and turned to Doyle.

"Feeling Lady Luck tonight?" Harry asked with a wicked smile.

Doyle quickly ran a hand under the table, feeling for the breaks, then scowled.  Emotions warred across his face: disappointment, frustration and a small hint of greed mixed with hope.  Doyle sucked his lips against his teeth while he considered then nodded once.

"Usual bet?" Doyle asked.  Harry pretended to consider and Doyle's face soured even more, knowing he was being mocked.

"Oh, why not?  Eh?" Harry chuckled and put the bills away.

The gaunt woman was speaking.  "...spirit slate will reveal the messages to you from The Beyond.  But beware the question you ask.  For some Spirits take a toll that is not easily paid."  A few of the ladies around the table gasped and even one or two of the men looked uneasy.

"I will bet the Spirits take cold hard cash easily enough," Harry mumbled.

Doyle kicked him under the table. "Do be quiet!" he whispered fiercely.

The gaunt woman introduced herself as Madame Zoska, a mystic from the Russian steppes, the thirteenth daughter of a woman who was the thirteenth of her sisters.  "Please," she said.  "Join hands so that the Spirits can know our voice as one."

 

An hour into the seance Harry had stopped mentally cataloging the various cons of Madame Zoska and settled into a mild stupor.  It was one of his own techniques he had developed to slow his heart beat and breathing for his underwater magic tricks.  While he viewed the dubious Madame's repertoire of tactics as cons, Harry did not feel that his own were.  Like any good magician he never professed to be performing anything except illusions.  He glanced over at Doyle who was concentrating so hard he was perspiring.  His friend was a rational man who wanted desperately to believe, to feel the power of the "World of Spirits".

As the others had used the slate Harry had not been able to make out the faint chalked writing on the walls behind them because the room was dark and smoky.  But his keen eyes had caught Madame Zoska's valets in the distance scribbling a word or phrase on the wall behind the current slate user.  Harry did not fully understand the properties of the slate that allowed it to act as a somewhat cloudy mirror that caught the faint chalked words behind the slate holder.  He had resolved however on his turn to try to break off a piece to take it back to the workshop for further analysis.

" Harry ," a young woman's voice whispered, so soft it might have been the wind against the walls outside.

He sat up straighter in his chair.  The speaker was obviously somewhere near by.  The slate was still a few patrons away from him so he assumed this was just a warm up.  He mentally ran through the last few patron's in his mind on their activities before they had gotten the slate.  Had they looked flustered?  As if someone was "whispering" their name from the Other Side?

" Harry, " said the voice, louder.  It was a teenager's inflection. Without turning his head, Harry looked carefully around the circle and then around the room looking for someone with moving lips or close enough to be making the voice.

"Now for your message from the Other Side, sir," said Madame Zoska.  "What is your Question?"

" Harry... "  The voice was louder now, enough that at least Doyle should have heard it.  For a second, he wondered if it was Doyle playing at some sort of prank.

"Doyle?" Harry said slowly.

"Yes?" Doyle opened his eyes, a look of frustration on his face as if he expected Harry to indicate a con the two of them had missed earlier and that he would now pay for.

"It is actually my turn, Madame Zoska," a man wearing a smoking jacket said.  He was two seats down from Harry .  The spirit slate board had been traveling around the circle, person by person, mark by mark, answering "questions".

Madame Zoska ignored the man and slid the slate in front of Harry using a long stick.  "The Spirits wish to talk to the Non-Believer," she said.

"But, but, I believe!" said the man petulantly.  Zoska silenced him with a wave of her hand.

Harry waited to hear the voice again and when he did not he picked up the slate and ran a hand under it checking for wires or any other device then placed it back on the table.  The others were staring at him expectantly.  Harry pretended to cough and turned his head away to look at the wall behind him.  It was empty from what he could tell. "Harry..." A cold feeling crept up Harry's spine and he smiled at the deliciousness of the feeling.  He had not felt even a mild emotional response in quite some time.

Doyle put a hand on Harry's arm.  "Harry?" he said, concern in his voice. "Are you well?" "Harry..." The voice overlayed with Doyle's voice making it sound like two people were speaking from the same lips.

Harry placed the slate face down in front of him.  There was a bowl of chalk on the table.  The mark was supposed to use it to write their question, speak it aloud three times and then the circle would chant it three times after that (to give the valets time to do their wall writing).  No one had been able to see each other's message because of the way the valets were angling their writing on the wall. Something angled on the wall perhaps , Harry thought. Added after we were all seated .

Harry turned to Madame Zoska.  "I believe the Spirits already know my Question."  Harry slid the slate back to the woman who had just been using it.  The man in the smoking jacket harrumphed as it went past him a second time, in the other direction.  Beside him, Doyle snickered in spite of himself and then tried to cover it by clearing his throat.

"Would you be so kind, Miss?" Harry asked the woman as the slate stopped in front of her.  The woman looked at Madame Zoska, unsure of what she should do at he break in protocol.  A few of the valets moved a step closer.  "I am curious to know if my answer might be somewhat similar to yours."

Madame Zoska watched the exchange with a thin-lipped smile that did not reach her eyes.  After a moment, she nodded to the woman who was holding her hand cautiously above the slate.

"What may I write for you?" the woman asked.

"If you would just hold it up and read it, please, my dear," Harry said.  The woman blushed at the familiarity but held up the slate slowly.

"It reads," she began slowly, trying to make out the message.  She turned the slate slightly upwards and Harry noted the angle so that he could check the exact position on the wall after the seance.  "It reads 'The Bottom of the Lake'."

Around the table everyone, including Doyle, jerked their heads towards Harry.

" Harry... " the voice whispered through thirteen different mouths.
