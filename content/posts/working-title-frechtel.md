-1- "Hey, science nerds!" Frechtel said from the hallway.

The hair on the back of Will's neck rose.  Beaks looked up at him from his workstation across the room.  Both instinctively checked the time.  Will could almost hear his co-worker's thoughts since the same were running through his head. A lot of labs on the floor...maybe just passing through...someone left donuts in the breakroom as a distraction... Frechtel stepped into their opened doorway.  Both men automatically put the pictures of their wives facedown on their desks as Frechtel sauntered into the room, spilling coffee out of an oversized mug as he did.  The man somehow managed to combine the regal, cavalier air of Hugh Hefner in a smoking jacket with everyone you have ever wanted to punch in the face.

Will clicked closed his personal and work To-Do lists.  The former wyas officially a lost cause and the latter was officially on the ropes.  "Super busy today, Fretchel," he said, knowing it was a pointless statement.

"Super busy," Beaks echoed.  He was staring hard at his computer's screen, trying to not to make eye contact.

"You should be," the small man said absentmindedly as he scanned the leftovers of Beaks's breakfast.  "Are you going to eat that biscuit?"  Beaks pushed a half-wrapped sandwich towards Frechtel without looking up.

"You're not sick, right?" Frechtel said as he carefully unwrapped the sandwich, opening each flap and folding it down in a perfect crease.

"I feel like I am going to throw up right now," Beaks said but Frechtel was focused on juggling his newly pilfered sandwich, a half-eaten cinnamon bun (probably also pilfered), and his giant coffee mug.  A little of the coffee sloshed onto Beaks's desk, also unnoticed by Frechtel.

He and Beaks and their team were coming in overbudget and behind schedule--always a winning combination with top brass.  They were threatening to armchair quarterback the project for him and Beaks. Maybe they send Frechtel down to finish off the weak teams.  Thin the herd. "How was your weekend, Frechtel?" Will asked politely.

Frechtel half climbed, half jumped onto Beaks's desk and sat down.  He put his oversized coffee mug down on some of Beaks's papers and took another bite of his pilfered biscuit.  "If I remembered their names I would tell you, Willamenia," he said, his legs swinging slightly and hitting against the desk.

Will ground his teeth at the Frechtel's latest nickname.  He almost preferred last week's nickname.  Almost.  He had been Willamenia, Willyahelpme, Willyahelpher, Will.I.Am, Will.I.Ain't, Wilbur, Willing-and-Able, Strobo (Will had no clue where that one came from), Parker (also no clue), Silly Willy, Free Willy,  Wacky Will, Big Willie, Little Willie, Will E. Coyote (Frechtel was really proud of that one) and a few dozen others that luckily had stopped making the rounds in Frechtel's vocabulary.

Frechtel placed his biscuit down and wiped his hands on Beaks's desk.  He picked up his mug and swirled the coffee slowly like it was brandy. "What about you two losers?"

"You were training for a race, weren't you, Big Willy?" Beaks said with a smirk.

Frechtel looked at Will with interest.  Will stared at Beaks. So that's how it was going to be. "Yes," Will said shortly.

Beaks was a good man, but good men broke under torture. Frechtel was bottled torture, aged to perfection and served with a side of stab-your-buddy-to-save-yourself.

"Which one?" Frechtel asked with feigned casualness.  "That donut run thing? Or one of your fraternity races?"

Will sighed.  "I am way past fraternities."

"But not sororities, amirite?"  Frechtel leered at him and did a sitting 'clubbing dance'.  He gave a high pitched laugh and slapped his leg.  After a few seconds of laughing his face grew serious.  "But it's your Greek stuff?  This race.  Spears and chicks in spandex and a lot of muddy guys."

"They're not in--," Will said then took a breath.  "It's just a regular race."

"Oh," Frechtel said, disappointed.  He liked exotic sounding activities.  According to him he had apparently done bungee jumping, sky diving, full contact chess and even even something called competitive canoe dancing.  "Mundane" sports did not interest the little accountant.  Then he shrugged. "When do you run--"

"I'm running it with my wife," Will added.  The second it was out of his mouth he knew he had made a mistake, a Grade-A rookie mistake.  Frechtel's eye's lit up and Beaks look up, smiling broadly--he had just gotten his morning back.

The little man hopped down from Beaks's desk and sauntered over to Will's, the half-eaten biscuit completely forgotten and abandoned.  "She's been after you for a while to get me over for dinner," Frechtel said.  "Technically that's against company policy since I can shutdown your whole project with a click of a key.  But maybe we can all train together."  Frechtel nodded as he considered the idea that he thought was a good compromise.

"Yes," Will said.  "Maybe we can."  His words were clipped and his voice neutral.  Like a wild animal you never made sudden or excited movements in front of Frechtel.  "Let me check our schedules."

"Don't schedule anything on weekends," Frechtel said with a wink.  He pulled up a chair in front of "Don't worry, big guy, I'll keep that infamous Frechtel charm turned off."

"I can't tell you how happy that makes me," Will said with only a minor hint of sarcasm.  He tried not to notice that Frechtel's toupee had shifted slightly.  What DID this guy have on management?

"Great.  We can probably do dinners, too, but just tell..uh..." Frechtel looked over Will's desk.  "Where's your wife's picture?"

"We burned them," Beaks said.

Frechtel either ignored Beaks.  "Hmmm...oh yeah, Jess.  Jessie.  The Jess-ter." Frechtel enuciated the nickname.  "Tell the Jess-ter to keep it simple and spontaneous.  That way I don't have to file a detailed Fraternization Disclosure form, just the short Summary version."

Frechtel grabbed his mug and headed for the hallway then stopped.  "How fast do you guys run?" he asked turning around.

Will perked up slightly.  He spent a lot of time thinking about various reactions and counter-reactions for his job. His brain raced now to determine which answer would create the reaction of Frechtel, jettisoning the idea of the race, moving on to his next victim and giving Will back his morning.

"6:00 minute mile," Will said with a mostly straight face.  He though that was fast enough that Frechtel would know he could not keep up, but not so fast he would think it was cool to run with Will and Jess for bragging rights.

Fretchel nodded.  "Me, too.  Well, normally.  But I hurt my leg a while back.  Slowed me down to a 13:00 minute mile.  Which is still respectable.  You guys can just keep circling back for me every quarter mile or so."

Frechtel looked out into the hallway again then gave an air fist bump, somehow managing to spill some of the coffee from the no-spill mug in his other hand.  "Did it this weekend, boss man," he said into the hallway.  "I'll drop by after I finish ripping these losers a new one over their cost overruns."  The person in the hallway said something Will could not make out. Great , Will thought.  If any of the other teams were unaware he was going to start asking for additional resources they knew now.  He could almost hear the whole floor being assigned "additional critical tasks" to lock them down into their current projects.

"Yeah," Frechtel said to the hallway.  "So just let me know when you're free and I'll drop by."

Frechtel had noticed the pool of coffee he had stepped in and was rubbing the bottom of his shoe against the side of the wall. "You guys live like pigs in here," he muttered.  Frechtel shook his no-spill mug at them presumably to demonstrate how neat-and-tidy people operated. This time the mug did not spill any coffee.  Frechtel walked back over to Will's desk, pulled up a chair and sat down.

"Since I have a few minutes to burn.  You know what I don't get about your Greek mud races?" he said, propping his feet up on Will's desk.

Will rubbed a hand over his face, leaned back and settled in for a long, long break. "What's that, Frechtel?"

There had to be a special place in Hell reserved for whoever had made Frechtel the owner and approver of every team's OPEX and personnel budget. -2- Will opened his front door.  "Oh good, you're home," Will's wife Jess said.  She was blocking the doorway and she was in running clothes.  Like he should have been.

"I should have called," he said.  She crossed her arms and cocked a hip.

"And..." Will said tentatively, "you are the most beautiful woman in the world."  Jess raised an eyebrow.  Will wracked his tired brain.  "And I am lucky--"  She pursed her lips considering waiting then gestured for more.

"Very, very.  So very, very lucky to be married to such a--"  Jess scowled and Will felt himself losing ground.  He tosses a Hail Mary.  "You're hair looks great".  He got both raised eyebrows and the scowl deepened as she took off her hat so he could get a good look at her hair pulled back into messy ponytail.  Will cursed to silently: rookie mistake.  Second one today.  "And your..." Will looked down at her running shoes.  No help there.

He sighed.  "I got nothing.  Will you accept 'I'm sorry'?"

Jess gave him a grin.  The same one that took his breath away the first time he saw it fifteen years ago and still did.  "You should have called," she agreed, kissed him lightly.  "It's a good thing you're smart AND pretty, Will Tanner."

She slipped past him.  "The kids have eaten but they are in the middle of a major blowout."

"The dog again?" Will asked.  Jess nodded and started off down the driveway in a light jog.

"Check the fridge"  she called over her shoulder.  "I may not have shoved ALL of your dinner in the disposal."

Will smiled as she disappeared down the street.  Then he heard his daughter yell from inside.  "Daaaaaaddy!  Aaron's being mean!"

"No, I'm not!" yelled his son from some in the house.

Will's shoulders slumped as he trudged inside. "We are not getting a dog," he said to no one in particular. The night went downhill from there. -3- Will cradled his phone to his ear, mentally reprioritizing tasks his personal To Do list.  Will was a list checker.  There was something deeply gratifying about knowing he had accomplished at least one thing in a day.  The hold music coming through the phone's speaker was starting to annoy him.

He squeezed the bridge his nose with his fingers, trying to stave off the oncoming headache. Every item on his list was "the most important thing to do".  The night--the entire day, really--had been a write off: Frechtel eating up the morning with banal conversation about...Will couldn't even remember.  Then a series of unscheduled, emergency project meetings popping up as everyone covered their 6.  Tonight, checking the kids' homework, eating dinner at the table rather than in his office to show penance.  He had finally been able to retreat here for a few moments of--

"Dad!" That was Will's son voice. Which was followed up a split second later by his daughter's.

"Daddy!"

"Stop! I'm talking to Dad, not you."

His daughter's voice went into a sing-song.  "Daddy-daddy-daddy!"  It was more of a challenge to his son than a call to him.

One or both of them was knocking, pounding really, on the door.  It was a race to see who he opened the door for, who had called his name last.  Will leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.

"Sir?" came a voice from Will's phone.

He sat up.  "Yes?  I'm here.  I'm here."  He could not hear over the kid's calling his name and pounding on the door.  Whatever they wanted had gotten lost in the competition to get him out of his bolt hole.  "Hold on," he said to the door.  The pounding and calling for him stopped.

"Excuse me?" the woman on the phone said.

"Not you," Will said to her.  "My kids.  They are trying to break down my door."

She was silent a moment then her voice softened slightly from the bored, official tone she had used up until now with him.  "Wait 'til their teenagers and they need money."  Her voice took on again some--but not all--of its official tone.  "I'm sorry, sir.  The supervisor was unable to step away.  It has been an 'active' night around here."

The pounding on the door started again and Will sighed.  "Have a free bed for one more?" he said tiredly.

The woman laughed.  "You are your father's son, aren't you, Mr. Tanner?" all of the 'official' tone was gone now.

"Dad been working his magic again?" Will asked.  The question both cheered him up and cut him to the quick.

"They don't make them like him any more.  Thank God!" the woman said and he could hear her smiling.  His dad did that to people.  Made them smile.  Pushed away the bad clouds for a while.  "He knows every one of our names, something about us, where we're from," the woman was saying.

"That's Mr. Tanner's boy?" Will heard someone say.  "Tell him to come on down."

"I wouldn't mind seeing what's a Tanner 2.0 look like," another woman said in the background and there was laughter.

"See what I mean," the woman on the phone said with mock severity.  "Every single person on this floor knows your dad and thinks theyyyyy are his favorite."

"So he's getting..." Will trailed off, knowing the answer.  He hated that 'hopeful little boy' tone in his voice.  He tapped his fingers on his desk in frustration.  Three quick beats.

"When he's with us," the woman said carefully.  She emphasized the word 'with'.  "But yes when he's fully with us I'm glad I can't get a lick of work out of anybody.  Everybody has an excuse to be in his room talking to him.  That man is a weapon of mass distraction."

Will laughed in spite of the tightness that was now squeezing his chest.  "How much is he 'there'?" he asked.

The woman consider her words for a second.  "His physician would be the best one to speak with you on that, Mr. Tanner," she said in her official tone again, but still gently and maybe a little sadly.

Dad had gotten to her, too, and she sounded tough as nails.  Will understood.  As a teenager they had fought, he and his dad.  It was not until Will was in his 20s that he understood why.  Tom Tanner just made you want to be a better version of yourself.  No, that was not it.  Tom Tanner made you believe you could be and maybe already were a better version of yourself.  He made you feel like you personally mattered.  Because that was Tom Tanner's gift: when you looked in his eyes you saw yourself reflected back as HE saw you--and Tom Tanner always saw the best of people.

He did not see a failure of a man on the verge of losing his wife, his job, his kids--nope, his father saw a man on his knees that would make everyone he loved proud as they watched him fight his way back to standing, showing them what real strength was.  He did not see broken people, he saw people who did not have to pretend to be whole anymore and could now start the process of healing stronger than they were before.  Even the most foul mouthed, no-manners, sullen teenager Will could find to bring over left the Tanner residence with a new mission in life, with purpose.

It was maddening.  The absolute last thing a teenage boy wanted ("Yes, I'm Tom Tanner's son.  I'll tell him.  I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that...") was to be a better version of himself.  So Will and his dad fought.  Will felt guilty for what he considered to be falling short of the mark which made him even angrier.  And so they fought more.  There were a lifetime's worth of words he wished he could take back now.

Sure that was all water under the bridge nowadays, Tom Tanner had said as much.  "Boy growing into a man throws a lot of elbows while he's trying to get that new skin on."  Still it didn't mean the 'elbows' didn't hurt. I am a coward, Will chided himself.  Tomorrow, he would go on the way home from work, like he had been doing in the beginning.  Maybe he would leave the office early.

"Mr. Tanner," the woman said.  "I can make sure my supervisor calls you back tonight.  But it might be really late."

"Thank you.  Any time is fine," Will said. -4- When he opened his office door Will found his two children waiting patiently.  When they had stopped the pounding he figured they had gotten bored and moved on or found something else to squabble about.  This level of dedication to their cause was bad news.

"We waited for you," his son said.

"So I see," Will said.  Definitely an ambush.

"For a hundred million hours," his daughter, Eve, said crossly.  She had recently picked up 'a hundred million' from somewhere so everything was 'hundred million'.  For a second, Will thought she was going to stamp her foot for emphasis and he struggled not to smile.

Aaron was leaning against the wall. His hands were tucked behind his back.  He stepped forward and Will could see he was holding some papers.  He was in that stage where he wanted his dad to see he was becoming grown up, but happy to be a kid talking about farts, and school, and other boy stuff when he thought Will was not paying attention.  Will did pay attention and it did his heart good to hear the raucous, unaffected laughter of his son and his friends.  Nobody was throwing elbows yet.

"Well, it was a very long time," his daughter said.

"Shouldn't you be in bed, little Miss?" Will said, but his daughter only crossed her arms they way her mother did sometimes and frowned. Will was in serious danger now of picking her up and hugging her and ruining her attempt at an "adult" bad mood. He shoved his phone in his pocket and strode out the door, leaving them rushing to keep up with his long-legged strides.

Will grabbed a beer from the fridge and mentally reviewed his To-Do list, shifting some items, deciding where they intersected with--

"Will, did you hear what Aaron said?" Jess asked him.  His wife was sitting at the kitchen table, papers spread out beside her laptop.

Will looked up. "Huh?"

Aaron squared his shoulders and stepped forward. "A dog is good for building character in kids."

Will popped the top on his beer and leaned back against the wall. Definitely an ambush. They had turned Jess too apparently.  Everyone wanted Will to have this stupid dog: his kids, his wife, his mother, Jess's mother, neighbors, even Beaks, though Beaks was probably just trying to needle him.  Everyone except Will had an opinion--the same opinion.  But there was one guy--numero uno--who was going to end up taking care of that dog and there was no space left on Will Tanner's To-Do list--on any of Will Tanner's To-Do lists.

"We've talked about this dog. The answer is still no," Will said simply.  Case closed.

"Yes, but I have been doing some research," Aaron said. He held the papers he was holding out to Will. "The APA did a study in--"

"The APA?" Will cocked his head. "The American Psychological Association?"

"Yes, them. They did a study on pet ownership--"

"You sure it wasn't the American Pet Association, bud?" Will said, smiling.

"No," Aaron faltered. "They--they--so they did a study on kids owning dogs.  Dogs helps kids build responsibility, they provide companionship, they--"

Will knelt down in front of his son and looked him in the eye. "Aaron, I am proud of you for doing this research. And for coming up with an argument to support your position. But my answer still is no--"

"But you didn't even listen!" Aaron yelled. As close as they were it hurt Will's ears. He stood up as Aaron tossed the paper on the ground. "You never listen to anybody!"

"Will-" his wife started.

"No dog!" Will was frustrated now. "Clear?" He looked at each member of his family until he was sure he had their full attention. "We have talked as a family. You two have expressed your opinions. Your mom and I have talked. The answer is No. Got it? Not with a debate. Not with more research. Not with tears, Eve. No."

For a moment, no one spoke. Then Eve stamped her little foot.

"You're bossy!" she yelled with tears brimming in her eyes. "And big girls don't cry!"  She ran from the room.

"May I go?" Aaron asked softly, carefully enunciating each word. Will nodded and Aaron walked out, his jaw set in anger.

After a moment, Jess wife, let out a breath. "Well."

Will pointed at his temple.  "No more space in this thing, babe. No more space. Are you going to--"

Jess held up a warning finger. "Don't. You do not do it by yourself, Will Tanner."

They stared at each other until Will looked away. After a minute, Jess stood and went to him, she snaked her arms through his and wrapped them around him.

"Smart guy aren't usually this tall," she said.

"I left my wallet at home, can you cover dinner?" Will said automatically.

"I think that's my ex-boyfriend," Jess said, her words muffled by his chest.

"I think I'm going to have another beer. You want one?" Will responded.

"What do you know about bull riding?" Jess said, looking up at him.

The spoke at the same time.  "Don't let go next time."

They both smiled and hugged tighter.  He felt even-keeled, safe and strong.  She felt a tornado that made a beautiful mess of his carefully laid plans for a boring life.  They were an anomaly in the data. No two people should have elected to have a second date after the epic failure of their first one. Even Frechtel would have been hard pressed to find something else to screw up that night. Will had been as surprised as Jess later admitted to being when she had kissed him and whispered her number in his ear.  He had memorized it since he had to hold her as the two of them supported each other while they limped up to her doorstep.

"Did you get to talk to Tom?" she asked.

"No," Will said. "He was having a bad night. Probably wouldn't know my voice, know me. So, no point.  Supervisor is supposed to call me back though to give me some updates on his condition."

Jess nodded, stepped back and sat down in front of her computer.  "That makes sense."  A year ago she would have pushed him to go see his dad, even this late the staff would let him in--everybody loved Tom Tanner.  But Tom Tanner was not 'there' much any more and she knew it hurt Will deeper than he let on to see it.

"What was the argument about?" Will said. "Between the kids. When I got home."

"Aaron wanted to name the dog (which I know we aren't getting) 'Algy' or something," Jess said.

Will laughed. "It that short for Alligator? Or it is really actually 'algae'?"

Jess shrugged.  "Some character on a new kid's show he's watching probably.  All the character on those things are weird these days."

Will scanned through the printout his son had given him. "I should have let him speak his piece.  That was one thing Dad was great at.  Letting people speak their piece." He stretched and took a swig of his beer and tossed it in the sink. "I'll put them to bed." He said as he kissed his wife on the top of her head.

Will tossed his beer into the recycling bin and did a quick scan of the kitchen. The dishes could soak for an hour. "What was little Miss's name for the dog? I heard her yelling something when I came home."

"Kermit the Frog," Jess said.

"Kermit the Frog the Dog?" Will asked.  "Well, it's definitely a name."

____________ -5- "Hey, Science Nerd! Hold that open," yelled Frechtel. Will's had just pushed the button for the lobby floor. His hand hovered between the Politely-Hold-Open and Close-the-Freakin-Door-Now-It's-Frechtel! buttons. That was how he thought of them at this moment. It turned out not to matter, Frechtel sprinted to the door and managed to shove his arm between the closing doors. For a brief second Will considered pushing the Door Close button just to see if it would slam closed on the small man's arm. A vision of the elevator rising with Frechtel pinned between the doors came to Will's mind. Would it slam into the floor's ceiling repeatedly or just-- "Gees!" Frechtel said, panting. "They really need to fix that Hold-Open button. It never works." Frechtel was dressed in a pair of tight running shorts over what appeared to be a tight yellow bodysuit. He had on a visor like blackjack dealers in Vegas used to wear and a waaaay-too-tight tank top. It originally had read "Beach Mode" but Frechtel had taken a marker and tried to change it to say "Beast Mode." "Tank Top Thursday," Frechtel said, smiling. "Sun's out, buns out, amirite?" Frechtel said, turning around to show Will his butt. Will looked away. "Been doing some squats to get ready for our marathon," Frechtel said, trying to look over his own shoulder to see his non-existent glutes. Will could not even find the energy to disagree. "Sure, Frechtel." Will's patience was wearing thin and this was the absolutely last thing he needed. Frechtel checked his watch. "You knocking off early?" "Going to see my Dad," Will said, hoping the conversation would stop there. But no, the Good Lord had decided to test Will today or maybe he was just entertaining Himself--it hard to tell when Frechtel was a part of the equation. Frechtel nodded sagely. "Ah. Yes. Well…" The little man was silent as the elevator began to climb. Will watched the indicator light as it slowly climbed the floors. Maybe his future at this company was foretold by him getting "relocated" to the very bottom floor, farthest from the top. Same floor as Frechtel. Had someone been trying to tell him something about his future or his project's future when they moved his team a few years back? "Will," Frechtel said. "I thought your Dad was dead." The comment was like a punch in the gut. Will actually staggered for a moment. He gripped the elevator handrail with one hand but he couldn't stop it or his free hand from tightening into fists. "No, Frechtel," Will said through slightly gritted teeth. "He is alive." Obnoxious, little, son-of-a…. Will prayed for patience and took a deep breath. A very, very deep breath. "Oh," Frechtel said again nodding in what he apparently assumed was a wise, sagely manner. "Because you stopped leaving early a while back so I just figured…" Red film began to color Will's vision. He drew hard on every bit of resolve he had. Everything. Literally. Will was a big man and big men who are not bullies learn early on how to dampen their strength. Will even affected a slight slouch to lower his 6'4" height to look less threathening. He found himself standing up to his full height. Please, God, please. I am going to literally kill him. "Hey, want to see something cool?" Frechtel asked. "Watch this!" Frechtel raised his finger. Will realized too late what he was doing. Frechtel's stubby finger jabbed into big, red Fire Emergency button. "No, Frechtel--" Will said in horror. "It's okay," Frechtel said, smiling. "It's disabled while they fix the Emergency--" The elevator slammed to an abrupt halt. Frechtel stared at the button and then at his finger. "That's weird. It's supposed to be disabled." Will stared at the button in shock. He was trapped. In an elevator. With Frechtel. Frechtel shrugged and smiled helplessly. "Maybe I missed a memo." Will stared at the floor indicator lights. They were dark but since the elevator's overhead lights had not shifted to the Emergency lights it meant he was trapped between floors. "Frechtel, I need to get out of this elevator," Will said. "Are you claustrophobic?" Frechtel asked, concerned. Will ignored him as he patted his pockets for his cell phone…and remembered at that moment putting it down on his desk while he fished his car keys out of a desk drawer. Well, at least, Frechtel had saved him coming back after seeing his Dad to grab his cell phone. Maybe he would get home at a reasonable hour tonight. "Frechtel, can you call Building Security on your cell phone?" Will said. Frechtel got a sheepish look on his face. "I don't carry it. The company hase software installed to track your location in the building. I don't want management thinking I am just floating around the floor not working. Should you really be cutting out early for personal reasons, though? What if your wife finds out? Does she have any sisters by the way? I've been meaning to ask you." Something tugged on his arm and looked back to see he was still gripping the elevator handrail. His knuckles were white. Had he taken a step towards Frechtel? Please, God, get me out of here. I am going to kick the crap out of this-- "Going to see my Dad remember, Frechtel?" Frechtel nodded in his stupid attempt at a stupid sage manner. Steady, Will.
"Yeah, yeah, right," the little man said, though his face showed he was only half-convinced. His look was almost sly. "Guess you're gonna be late! Haha!" Frechtel grinned broadly. Will scowled. Frechtel tapped on the elevator doors as if testing them. "Dad. I'm guessing cancer." Frechtel gave him a searching look. When Will did not respond he went back to tapping the door. "You'll be glad when that's all over, huh, buddy So you can focus on your failing project again," Frechtel said. Will had never noticed just how nasal and sing-song Frechtel's voice was. Would Beaks be onboard with an alibi? There was a sound of squealing and Will realized he had ripped the handrail halfway out of its fastenings. Will could not let go of handrail. He did not dare. Still his arm length could put him within reach of the little man's throat. "Frechtel, please, shut your--" "Oh, wait! You have to hit it twice to get it moving!" Frechtel said. He stabbed the Fire Emergency button twice in rapid succession. The lights immediately shifted to the Emergency bulbs and the building's fire alarm went off. Frechtel looked at Will and raised his eyebrows. "Maybe a couple of memos." The handrail pulled away completely from the side of the elevator. Somehow Will had turned around, gripped the thing with both hands and yanked with all of his strength. The red film had reduced his vision to near pinpoints. He did not pray. He did not want to. He wanted to kill this evil, little man. Instead he sucked in a ragged breath. Maybe the Lord wants me to kill Frechtel! No, no! Stop it, Will! Still the thought felt good. Finally, someone to pay for everything. Someone to punish for all of the-- Will gripped the bar and squeezed it. He shut his eyes so tight tears formed. "That's too big to pry the doors open," Frechtel yelled between horn blasts. Will dropped it and began pounding on the doors. "Help! I'm trapped in here!" He could hear people shuffling beyond the doors. Please God let them hear me. I can't go to prison for murder. Frechtel joined in with the yelling. "Help! Help!" Eventually the sound of shuffling feet died off and something deflated in Will. Ironically, it brought back some of his patience. Frechtel had stopped pounding and yelling for help, too. He looked at Will curiously. "You crying, big guy?" He stepped forward and tried wrap his arms around Will. "I won't let anything happen to you. You're safe." Will shoved him away roughly. Frechtel did not seem to notice that it was not a light shove. "It's just a small box that we might fall to our deaths in." Frechtel laughed. He laughed high pitched like a jackal. Like the Devil. Will spun around. "Just shut up!" he screamed into the little man's face. Their noses were inches apart. Will could feel spittle flying from his mouth as he yelled. "Shut your--" Will screamed every obscenity he had ever learned. His famous self control and resolve was gone. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew this screaming rage was all the only outlet keeping him from wrapping his hands around the annoying, evil little man's throat. Will went on what had to be two minutes until he finally stopped. His lower lip hurt and he thought he might have bitten it at some point in his rant. He was breathing hard but had somehow had unconsciously shoved himself against the far wall, almost into one of the corners. As far from Frechtel as possible. Other than the sirens piercing the air every two seconds the two men were silent. Frechtel stared at Will with his mouth wide open. He closed it slowly while Will breathed in deep, deep breaths. "Uh…I missed about half of that because of the sirens. Can you do it again with those parts in the sil--" Will launched himself forward. Frechtel moved like lightning, diving under Will's outstretched arms. Will could not halt his forward progress and slammed into the wall. He spun around, all thought gone, only deep seated rage coursing through every vein, muscle and bone in his body. He charged the little man again but at the last second the man dodged again. As Will turned to grab Frechtel something sprayed in his eyes. "You maced me?!" Will bellowed. One hand shot up to rub vigorously at his eyes, but the other was swinging wildly, searching for the little man. "Hate you-hate, die you.." That was him screaming. He didn't care. His eyes cleared slightly at the same time his other hand managed to find a piece of Frechtel's clothing. He went to grab the little man around the throat but something hard and sharp slammed into his chest. He staggered back, eyes still blurry, clutching at his chest. "What the--what did you do?" he spat, hands running over his chest. He saw that Frechtel was holding some sort of epi-pen. Reason flooded back in. His heart. Frechtel had stabbed him in the heart with-- "Are you done yet?" Frechtel asked calmly. But it wasn't Frechtel's voice. Will looked up. "What?!" he gasped. Frechtel spoke slowly enunciating each word. "Are…you…done…yet?" The voice was so un-Frechtel it caught Will offguard. It was not nasally or sing-songy or even remotely annoying. It sounded…normal. Will stared at Frechtel then nodded slowly. He leaned forward and put his hands on his knees. Was he out of breath because of the epi-pen or the mad scramble a few seconds ago? He leaned back against the wall and slid down into a sitting position. Better to be on the floor before the epinephrine hit. He needed to get to a hospital. The thought reminded him of why he was in the elevator in the first place but instead of anger something else came. A different feeling. Relief…? Frechtel reached over and pressed the Fire Emergency button three times then the door open. The alarm stopped in the elevator but Will could still hear it going off in the rest of the building. The door muffled it heavily. No wonder no one had heard him yelling for help. Frechtel sat down against the wall opposite of Will. "That's better," he said. "Nothing in that epi-pen by the way. It's a trainer. I just needed to get your attention before you killed me." Will stared at Frechtel. He sounded so normal. Even his posture seemed different. He was straight-backed and stared directly into Will's eyes. It was like watching a dog speak French. Will's mind reeled. "What did you mace me with?" he asked. His eyes had cleared up. Frechtel shifted so that he could pull something out of his pocket. It was an inhaler. He smiled at Will. Frechtel looked at the inhaler. "Water, I think is what they put in it. Maybe some lemon for taste. That's probably what was stinging." Will was so tired. Exhausted. Frechtel tossed him the inhaler and then the epi-pen. Will caught them both and examined them. "You science nerds want proof of everything," Frechtel said with just a hint of his normal annoyingness. Will examined the epi-pen, it was in fact a trainer. The inhaler did in fact say it was just water and lemon flavoring. Something else that looked like a preservative. Will memorized it to look it up later. "So what are you some sort of corporate spy?" Will asked. Why was he so exhausted? He felt like he HAD run a marathon with Frechtel. "Of course not! I'm an accountant," Frechtel looked offended. "Will, I control the budgets of every lab and division at this company. Including headcount and project staffing levels. Do you know how many sycophants I'd have chasing me if I didn't annoy or That's-What-She-Said them into hiding? Sycophants means ass-kissers, by the way." "I know what sycophant means--" Will started to say then stopped when he saw the other man smiling at him. Will tossed the inhaler and epi-pen back to Frechtel who tried and failed to catch them in the air. "So not completely an act," Will said smiling. Frechtel shrugged. "Kernal of truth in the legend." They were silent for a while. Will noticed that the alarms had stopped in the rest of the building. People would be trudging back in soon. He looked up at the Emergency lights to see if they had switched back to the regular ones. They had not. "It's okay to feel guilty, by the way," Frechtel said. Will looked back to Frechtel. "What? Thinking you're a jerk?" "Wanting it to end with your dad," Frechtel said. He stared Will hard in the eye. Their eyes remained locked until eventually Will looked away. "It will be a relief. And you will hate yourself for feeling that. Even when you nod as everyone tells you the BS about them being 'out of pain now' or 'in a better place'. You will feel like you betrayed them somehow." Will kept his gaze on the floor and said nothing. "Alzheimers?" Will started to tell Frechtel to mind his own business but instead he nodded. "How did you know?" "You didn't flinch when I mentioned cancer, age is about right, stuff like MS would have hit him a long time ago, your visits getting less frequent over time," Frechtel said, ticking the points off on his fingers as he went. He pointed Will with at his remaining finger. "Obessive use of To-Do lists to deal with emotions." Will shrugged, resisting the urge to touch the To-Do list in his back pocket. Because of the way he was sitting his pen was jabbing into his leg slightly. It was like an accusing finger. "You sound like you have some experience, Fre-- actually what is your first name? It feels weird calling you 'Frechtel' when you talk like--well, normal," Will said. "It's in the Directory," Frechtel said. "Look it up. Yes, I do have experience with it. That's not in the Directory. Or anywhere else." Frechtel pursed his lips obviously debating how much to reveal…whoever he pretended not to be. "Fiance. Three months before we had planned to get married. Actually that night we were celebrating moving the date up. Drunk driver. We hit a tree, she got really hurt. Brain injury. I only got a piece of glass. One tiny piece of glass," Frechtel raised his arm and showed Will his elbow. Will could just barely make out a small white line running across it. Something about the story sounded off, something in the way Frechtel recited it by rote. It felt true, but… "You were the drunk driver," Will said, though that still felt incomplete. Frechtel looked surprised and almost…scared? Yes, but not of Will. Of something, though. After a moment, the little man relaxed. "Freakin' science nerds…yes, I was drunk, but so drunk we decided she should drive. She wasn't drunk but still lost control of the car. Rain, mud, tired? No one could ever really put together the chain of events." "But if you hadn't been so drunk…" Will said. "Maybe," Frechtel said looking at his feet stretched out in front of him. Will doubted he was seeing them. "She seemed fine at first. Blood pocket on the brain. Then it started. She began losing little pieces of memory, other stuff. Once she called me by her old boyfriend's name. That was a bad night." Will snickered and Frechtel gave him a dour look. "Not…not during that. That actually would have been better. It was just sitting at breakfast. Asked me what I wanted to do that day. Like we--or he and she--had been together for years and were just having a normal day." "The blood bruise was slowly expanding. Got caught in an MRI when she started falling down. Then it was just a long, slow slog to the end. Her forgetting pieces of our lives. I am sort of lucky compared to you, though," Frechtel said. "I just had a few years with her for her to lose. You had decades that got lost with your Dad." Will looked at his own feet without seeing them now. "Something like that," he said quietly. "By the end, she got scared of me. Screaming terror. Climbing the bed type of thing. They had to restrain her. She had had some less than nice guys in her past. Somehow she attached one to my face. I thought the staff were going to toss me out but she was in a facility probably like your Dad is. They knew how to deal with that stuff there. Though they did question me pretty heavily to be sure." Frechtel rubbed his face like he was trying to rub it off. Will considered maybe the 'mask' Frechtel wore everyday had more purposes than even he might be aware of. "I used that last one as my excuse," Frechtel sighed and drew his knees up to his chest. He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around his knees. "I didn't want to 'upset her'." He made air quotes with his fingers. "Though check the Visitor Logs and you'll see I had been getting 'busy' well before then." Frechtel looked at Will's arms. "I'm not sure what would be worse, being small like me and too weak to go after all those guys in her past or being big like you but having no one to fight." The two men stared at each other. Then Will smiled. "It's always better to be big. Trust me." Frechtel burst out laughing and Will joined in. Soon the two were practically cackling. It took a few minutes but eventually each managed to get themselves under control. Will's sides hurt, though. When had he last laughed like that? "I'm assuming you'll go back to being a jerk when he get out of here. We'll pretend this never happened," Will said. Frechtel pointed at Will and winked.
"Good," Will said. "Then I can tell you freely I feel like I am failing at everything, Frechtel. As a parent, a husband, here," Will waved a hand to encompass the building around them. "I feel like I am doing a crappy job leading my team. You guys are probably going to fire me, maybe Beaks, too." Will looked at Frechtel for some sign of verification or disagreement but the little man's expression did not change. Complete poker face. What did I expect from a guy who spends most of his time convincing us all he's a jerk. Frechtel took his time responding. "Yes," he said finally and Will's heart fell. A small hint of anger came back. Everything he had sacrificed for this place and-- "You are screwing up as a father. Not sure about the husband part. But you should get the dog." Will started to ask Frechtel how he knew about that but Frechtel waved him to silence. "You take your personal calls in the car, and not in the breakroom outside my office. Anways, guys like you need someone take care of. What most men consider chains are actually anchors for you. Maybe that's why your Dad hurts so much. You're not just loosing an anchor chain, you are losing it link by link." Will did not speak for a second. He considered what Frechtel said. "You think I should get the dog?" Frechtel nodded vigorously. "Definitely. Your whole family needs it. You won't let them take care of you so they want something to pour themselves into. I don't have kids," and Frechtel's voice caught ever so slightly. Most people might have missed it, but Will thought he might know what else had been lost to Frechtel that night. His heart ached in sympathy. Frechtel did not see to have noticed. "They have names for it already, right?" Frechtel was saying. Will sighed and nodded. "My daughter wants 'Kermit' and my son wants 'Algae'." Frechtel pursed his lips, thinking. "Kermit makes sense," he said. "Did your son mean algae like the stuff in the water or Algernon like the mouse in Flowers For Algernon?" Will sat up. "What?" "The book Flowers for Algernon," Frechtel said. He was looking at the bank of floor buttons. He started to stand up. "Wait, why does Kermit make sense? What kind of sense?" Will stood up, too. "And what book?" Why did Will feel like some man who had--and Will had gone out of his way to make sure of this--never, ever met his kids. Why did he feel like this man knew something about his kids he did not. Something he had missed. Maybe Frechtel is paying more attention than you are, a voice inside of him said. He is paying attention. It felt creepy somehow, but also is shamed Will. What was so important on all of his To-Do lists? What was the real value of the things e was checking off? Frechtel was peering closely at the buttons. "The Muppets," he said, not looking at Will. "You liked them?" Will tried to catch Frechtel's eye then just put a hand on his shoulder and turned the man toward him. He did it carefully. Aware that a few moments ago he had been trying to catch the little man to strangle him. Frechtel tore his gaze away from the buttons. "So your dad probably thought she would like them, too. Or was just falling back on what he knew from his time as a parent. Old people do that a lot. Kermit sings that song in one of the shows. Maybe a movie." Frechtel opened his mouth and sang softly. Saying Good Bye, Why is it Sad?
Makes Us Remember the Good Times We've Had
Touching A Hand, Wondering Why,
It's Time for Saying Good Bye "There's some other stuff after that. But I think your daughter's young. You should check it out." Will was stunned. He had a vague memory of picking up his daughter from his Dad's after his wife and he had been out on a date. Picking her up at the Dad's facility… Eve had been talking about the Muppets, hadn't she? The nurses had put it on for her, not Dad. Old video someone had laying around.
He struggled to stuff in information and the shock into a box in his mind and close it off for now. "And the book? My son?" Frechtel pulled the epi-pen out of his project and looked at it. "Uh, yeah." He looked up at Will. "It's about a guy who's mentally retarded but they do something to him--some scientists do in an experiment--to make him a genius. They do the same thing to a mouse named Algernon. But then the guy realizes that at the factory where he was a janitor, that people weren't being nice to him. They were actually making fun of him, bullying him." Frechtel extended the needle of the epi-pend. Will instinctively took a step back. "Good thing I didn't break it off in your chest," Frechtel said. Frechtel started to spin the epi-pen around in his hand then seems to think better of it. He pointed it at Will. Will put up his hands and Frechtel, realizing what he was doing, immediately lowered his hand. "Sorry. Ah, soooo, so the guy becomes a genius but it's horrible to find all that out. Then he starts to slowly lose all of the intelligence. Can't understand his own highly advanced writings from a week before. Stuff like that. A lot like Alzheimers actually though that wasn't classified as a disease when this was written." Frechtel bent down and pushed on the center of the Fire Emergency button, thrusting the needle into the center of it. There was a 'ding' sound and the elevator started moving upwards. Will looked at the doors and then up at the floor indicator lights. They were climbing towards the Lobby. "So," Frechtel went on. "The mouse dies and you know then you know the guy is going to as well. He can't handle knowing he's going to be like he was and that he'll be the butt of everyone's jokes again but not even be smart enough to know it. He goes off…they don't really say. But he leaves the factory at the end of the book." The elevator stopped at the Lobby and dinged again. Frechtel pushed the Door-Close button and held it. "Go home, Will," he said in a very un-Frechtel voice. "Your project is not getting cancelled. We're ramping you up. Reorganizing the teams and resources so you have what you need." "How--" Will said. He shook his head to clear it. Or maybe there was something in that epi-pen. This whole elevator ride had been a constant roller coaster. Now, he not only wasn't fired, he was getting more people and, it sounded like, lab real estate. "I told Upstairs you weren't failing, just understaffed. Will, why do you think I had you moved down to the basement when we changed buildings? To my floor? Does management ever come and look over your shoulder? You might get called Upstairs to for a meeting but no one ever pops in on you. They might run into me. I see your project's value," Frechtel said. He released the Door-Close button then pushed it again quickly. "Keep that to yourself, though. I have to fire some people." That sobered Will immediately, dampening his good mood. A roller coaster. Frechtel noticed the troubled look on his face. "It has nothing to do with you or your project, Will. Why do you think I come in every weekend to do my regular work? So I can walk around during the week and see what everyone is really up to." "So you are a spy, just for management," Will said. Frechtel released the Door-Close button. "No, Will. I'm just the 'janitor' no one expects." The door opened and Frechtel stepped out. There were a crowd of people waiting. A few looked at Will curiously and he wondered if he had a blood spot on his chest from where Frechtel had stabbed him. Then he followed their eyes down to the handrail on the ground. "It fell," Frechtel said in his usual annoying voice. "Will's not used to handling something big and hard like that." Frechtel waited. "That's what she said," he exasperated. "You people have no sense of humor." He turned back to Will and in the most Frechtelly voice Will had ever heard the little man use said, "And let me know about your wife's sisters. Or your wife if it doesn't work out between you guys. I'm not picky." Then he cackled like a jackal and walked off. People got on the elevator and Will stayed on to ride back for his phone. "What a jerk," someone muttered. "Yep," Will said. A few others muttered their agreement.
