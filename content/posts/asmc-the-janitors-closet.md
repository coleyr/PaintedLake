Daniel squeaked slightly as he felt himself being pulled backwards.  He was falling then his back slammed into the wall and his head bounced against it next.  His glasses were knocked askew then he felt rather than saw a slim hand yank them off his nose.  A door slammed and the lights came on.

"Whaaaa---"

"Shut it, Danny boy."

"Michelle?" Daniel asked.  The figure in front of him was blurry but he thought he could make out enough of the features to see it was her.  "What are we doing?"

"We?" Michelle asked acidly.  "In your dreams, Virgin Sacrifice.  WE are doing nothing.  YOU are answering questions."

Daniel felt carefully around him.  "Are we in...are we in the janitor's closet?"

"No, this is where I bring all my conquests."

"Really?" Daniel asked.

"No!  None of your business, creep!" Michelle yelled.

"But you, me, you pulled me in here," Daniel protested.

"So you think I am slut, Danny Boy," Michelle said.  There was a dangerous undertone in her voice.

"Uh, no I meant, wait, what are you doing in here in the first place!"  Daniel demanded.

"Waiting for you to walk by."  Daniel heard Michelle pick up something and flip it over.  Her blurry form sat down.

"Take a seat, DB," she said.

"That acronym can be taken in a number of different ways," Daniel said,  but he slid down the wall into a sitting position.  "Can I have my glasses back?"

"No," Michelle said.  She seriously considered dropping them onto the ground and crushing them for half a minute.  Instead she put them into her jacket pocket.

Daniel tried to adjust his position and was jabbed in the ribs by something blunt.  He recoiled from it only to get poked in his arm hard by something else on the other side.

"Ow! Gees, it must be hard to have sex in here," he said, rubbing where he had been jabbed.

Michelle stared open mouthed then sighed dramatically.  "Teenage boys.  Don't you ever think about anything else?"

Daniel opened his mouth partially in shock at what she had said, partially what he had said, and partially because he suddenly was very aware that he was alone in a small, confined space with a girl.  A very mean, but also very female girl.

"So..." he said, then trailed off.  The silence hung between them for a few seconds.

"Why are you helping me?" Michelle blurted out.  "Why do you care?"

"Huh?" Daniel said.  He had been trying not to think about certain things and the sudden question caught him off guard.  "The Club.  The--I think it will be fun to try to figure out a real crime."  As soon as the words left his lips he knew it was a mistake. You can't un-ring a bell, chief. Daniel's grandfather always said that and the words flooded into his mind, choking off his attempt to take back his words.  "Ahhh...um..."  A sound like a thousand bees buzzing filled his ears.  He put his fingers in his ears trying to clear them. Breathe, Daniel, he thought.

"Fun."  Michelle muttered.  She scowled.  "Fun."  The dangerous undertone was back.  She leaned back and put a hand on the doorknob.  "Have a nice life, Danny Boy, you are free to go."  She started to twist the handle then stopped and looked up at it.  "That's weird," she said, right as the buzzing in his ears began to fade.

Because of the buzzing and since she was still blurry shapes and angles in the dark light Daniel missed her trying the door handle.  "It's not weird," he said, thinking she was still talking about his explanation.  "Okay, maybe a little."

"What?" Michelle said, looking back at him, slightly confused.  "You don't think it's weird?"

"Fine.  It's weird.  A lot weird, but..." Daniel trailed off for a second.  "It is actually the reason I joined the Club."

Michelle looked between Daniel and the door handle.  "You lost me.  I mean on a scale of 1 to Stupid that makes no sense."

Daniel took a deep breath and let it out heavily.  "Have you ever seen an angel?  A real one, not the carved ones on the church downtown."

Michelle watched him carefully.  She tried the door again and when it would not turn let her hand fall quietly onto the handle of a broom standing upright near her.

"We're passed Stupid and into Loco, Danny Boy," Michelle said.  "You are officially scaring me now.  And that says a lot since you apparently are blind as a bat and have those toothpick arms of yours."  She pointed up at the door handle with her free hand.  "Did you do this somehow when I pulled you in here?"

"Do what?  Wait did you say 'Toothpick arms'?"

"Well, they are--"

"Can you just shut your stupid, sexy lips for two minutes so I can explain?" Daniel yelled.

"Sexy?" Michelle said, raising an eyebrow.  "You think my lips are sexy?"

"What?  I never said that.  I said 'stupid lips.  Stupid.  Like your Stupid scale and this stupid closet"  Daniel climbed to his feet, knocking over some cleaning supplies.  He groped forward until his hand found the door handle.

"Don't bother, Danny Bo--"

Daniel twisted it and yanked the door open.  "Keep the glasses!  You probably broke them already anyways."

"Hey!" Michelle said, shooting to her feet.  "How did you--"

Daniel rounded on her.  "You want to know why I care?  Because, because I didn't once and Rodney did and something happened.  To him!  Rodney!  To him.  Because--as you so eloquently pointed out--I am a coward.  I did nothing.  Rodney?  He did and I think he was... I-, I-, I don't know what but he just was or maybe the kid was.  I don't know.  I just know this time I want it to be me.  To happen to me!"

Daniel stopped.  He was breathing hard.  He felt around in his jacket pocket for his inhaler.  "Aw heck!  I lost my inhaler in here somewhere and you won't give me my glasses and I can't--"  He threw his hands up in the air.

Michelle did not respond.  She was staring at the door handle.  She touched it tentatively.  It had been crushed into a tiny misshapen ball with faint lines that appeared to be finger width apart running across it.

"Far out," she said.

Daniel knelt down on the floor and began sweeping his hands around trying find a shape that felt like an inhaler.  He accidentally swept his hand into the brick wall and one of the bricks cracked.  "Oh that's just great.  Now I have to replace the drywall in here.  My dad is going to be ecstatic."

Michelle's eye tracked his movements.  They took in the wall, the crack and what was left of the door handle again.  Daniel swiped at something else and she instinctively took a step back.  "Calm down, Danny Boy," she said, her mind trying to make sense of what she was watching.  "You were telling me about angels.  You and Rodney saw them."

Daniel sat back on his haunches, frustrated.  "No, that's not what I said.  Stop trying to make me sound craz--ow!  Is everything in this stupid closet made of cheap plastic!!??"  Daniel had just accidentally thrust his hand through a metal bucket as he was gesturing in frustration.

"Danny--Dan--Daniel! Stop! Let me help you before you cut yourself," Michelle said.

"What?  Oh..." Daniel said, holding his hand up, seeing the bucket on it.

"Just breathe," she said, edging closer to him.

"I am--sorry," Daniel took a deep breath.  "I. Am. Trying. To breath.  I need my inhaler.  Which is on the floor somewhere apparently because it's not in my pocket."  He felt her fingertips touch his forearms lightly and he froze.  "What are you doing?"

"Letting you know where I am so that you don't knock me into the walls with all your flailing," Michelle said.  She watched him carefully as she moved closer.  She had no intention of removing the bucket only distracting Daniel long enough for her to slip by and open the door.  "So Rodney and you saw angels or something?"  A few steps more...

"No, more like he became one and I just watched it all happen," Daniel said tiredly.

The idea was so absurd that it stopped Michelle in her tracks.  "Rodney...became...an...angel?"

"I think so," Daniel said.  "Maybe."

"Rodney that goes to this school?  Rodney that is dumber than a dyslexic poodle?"

"Hey!" Daniel protested.  "He IS my best friend, you know."

Michelle held up her hands in a placating gesture.  "Sure.  Right.  Got it."  Two more steps.

"It was at the State Fair.  When it was in Loganville a few years back.  Did you go to it?" Daniel had a strange note of hope in his voice.

Michelle stopped edging towards the door.  She remembered that Fair very well because she was not at it.  She had been caught sneaking back into her bedroom the weekend before and had been grounded.  She thought no one in the town had gone because it was so far away and so expensive to get there.

"No," she said.  "You and Rodney were there?"

"My dad took us," Daniel said.  "It was the year my mom died.  So he was trying to do a lot of stuff with me back then.  So he took me and Rodney over there."

Michelle had no idea that Daniel's mom was dead.  She only knew Daniel's father was the Sheriff because she had been picked up from the Sheriff's Station half-a-dozen times by her parents in the past few years.  She decided not to mention she was only now realizing Daniel's mom was dead.

"Was it fun?" she asked.  Michelle had always felt like that Fair would have been one of the most amazing experiences of her life.  She had refused to speak to her father for a month and had spoken, very loudly, to her stepmother for much longer than a month.  She spent most of that year livid and the one following.  Deep down she had always felt robbed for some reason.

"Yeah," Daniel said.  "Until John Suse died."
