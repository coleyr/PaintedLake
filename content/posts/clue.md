"T.J.," Daniel said, his voice cracking slightly.  "What's up, homie?"  As soon as the words left his mouth Daniel regretted them.  He felt Michelle's disapproving stare boring into the back of his skull.

"You tell me, home slice."  T.J. over-enunciated the moniker.  He stepped further into the room and slammed the door.  Daniel felt his throat go dry as he heard the lock click into place.

T.J. turned around slowly, almost cautiously.  He gave the overturned furniture a sidelong glance then continued.  "Word on the street is 2nd Place here is trying to frame me for Sarah's disappearance."

"2nd Place?" Rodney asked, looking at Michelle.Michelle scowled.  "He means 2nd to Sarah--"

"In everything!" T.J. said.  "Brains, cheerleading, hotness.  Everything."

"So you think she's hot?" Rodney asked, nodding toward Michelle.

"What?  No way!" T.J. protested.  "You twisted my words around."

"That is actually what you said," Michelle said.  She smirked viciously.  "Almost word for word."

Daniel nodded then realized what he was doing and scratched his ear to try to hide it.

T.J. made a fist.  "Keep it up, homeboy.  Let me make this real simple to all of you."  He shook his fist at Rodney.  "Especially you."

"I had nothing to do with Sarah disappearing.  We aren't even together any more."

"What!?!" Daniel said.  "Since when?"

"Since your momma," T.J. said.  "Since I caught her--just were not dating.  So I didn't kill her."  He looked around the room.  "Understand?"

"So like broken up permanently or taking a break?" Daniel asked.

Michelle sighed dramatically.  "Did she know that ?"

T.J. Shrugged.  "Did you, 2nd?"

"When was this?" Rodney asked.  "Never mind.  Do you have an alibi?"

" For what ?  The last week?" T.J. Asked incredulously .  "I was at school and football practice .  Coach will vouch for me."

"You could have done it!"  Michelle said , her hands were balling into fists.  "The whole team would lie for you .  And half the people in this town ."

"Maybe," T.J. said.  "Maybe not.  But for now--" he unlocked the door and opened it.  "Just go back to your dragons and dungeons."

T.J. left and closed the door behind him with only a mild slam.  The room was silent.

"So now we..." Rodney trailed off.  "He always surprises me with how big he is when I see him in person."

"Do you think it is a permanent break up?" Daniel asked no one in particular.  "She must be devastated."  He sat down heavily in his chair.

"Calm down, Romeo," Michelle said.  "We have to find her first before you propose."  When she saw Daniel's eyes light up she continued.  "Assuming she wanted to date the poster boy for lack of Wheaties."

"But he did it. Practically said it right there."

"I don't--" Rodney started.

"He has a manufactured alibi and a broken heart.  You need me to draw you a picture, Sherlock?" Michelle asked Rodney who blushed slightly and turned away.

"Broken up," Daniel mused. "That is great news."

"I am so screwed," Michelle said.  She turned to go.  "Just get some evidence on him.  I'll be in touch."  She left.
