Callowyn stared into her cup of coffee.  For hundreds of years people had sat in rundown hole-in-the-wall dives just like this and looked for answers in cheap plastic cups of the disgusting brown liquid.  There was some strange consolation in the thought.

"Tea leaves and coffee  beans," she said.  The virtual ordering screen popped up in front of her face, mistaking her speaking for the start of an order.  For some reason it made her smile.  She looked up and noticed the man two seats down the diner's counter was watching her.  The glare from the florescent lights made the plastic barriers between each turn-style seat shimmer slightly.  Callowyn realized her mask was retracted and reflexively brought a hand up to cover her mouth and nose.  It would have been more subtle to just disrobe and throw herself against the plastic barrier between them.

The man dipped his head slightly--nothing that would be noticeable to the other diners--in acknowledgement and turned away.  No flirting going on here, just a soul tired woman looking for answers, Callowyn thought.  Five years ago she might have taken a tumble with the guy to kill the boredom for a while.

Callowyn drained the really bad coffee in a single drink and pushed the empty cup and saucer towards the edge of the counter so a serving robot could collect and sanitize it for the next customer.  When she pulled up the virtual ordering screen it informed her that her coffee had been paid for already.  Callowyn looked over at the man two seats down.  He was watching futbol on the overhead.

"Hey," Callowyn said.  The man turned around and she nodded as she pulled her mask over her mouth and nose.  He stood and the two of them walked out of the diner.

"I don't live far from here," Callowyn said, "but you can't stay over.  I have to work tomorrow."

The man looked at her slightly perplexed and cocked his head.  After a few seconds, he blushed.  It made the black of his mask stand out.

I am really rusty, Callowyn thought.

"I..." the man said.  "I just wanted to ask you a few questions."
