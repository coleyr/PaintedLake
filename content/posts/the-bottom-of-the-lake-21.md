The seance was across town in one of the up-and-coming neighborhoods.  Rather than being prestigious and staid, it was vibrant with a hint of new money on the scene.  Dobbs parked the car at the head of an alley and opened the door for them.  Harry noticed the large man was continually scanning the alley and adjoining street.

"Expecting trouble, Mr. Dobbs?"

"Just 'Dobbs', sir, please.  And no, no trouble."  Harry followed Dobbs' gaze over to a few teenagers trying to look tough, loitered on the street corner near the mouth of the alley.  They noticed Dobbs and after a moment of recognition, quickly cleared out.

Arthur stepped out of the car.  He smirked at quickly disappearing figures in the distance.  "Connoisseurs of the darker side of the ring, I see."  He turned to Dobbs.  "You have fans.  Isn't that grand."

Dobbs closed the car door.  "You want I should come inside, Mr. Doyle?"

"No, no, my good Dobbs.  We will be right as rain."

Arthur took Harry's arm and led him toward a door off the side of the alley.  As Arthur opened it a faint aroma of cigarettes and perhaps opium wafted out.  The two stepped inside and found themselves in an anteroom for a small coffee and tea shop.  A few late night carousers, mostly students by the looks of their clothes, huddled around tables debating or joking or reading.

Arthur left Harry and went to the man behind the counter and bent his head forward for a quiet conversation.  The man shook his head and Arthur began whispering at him more forcefully.  Harry turned to scan the room, bored.  Arthur would get them in or he would not.  There was nothing to be done with--

Harry stopped cold.  Sitting two tables from him was Bess.  She wore different clothes than she had earlier that evening.  Something he had not seen her in, but he thought women were wont to buy new clothes with the mood struck them.  Harry shook off that line of thinking and scolded himself.  Bess was nothing if not frugal.  She had stretched every penny they had to get them from town to town and state to state and through every shoddy rundown venue or carnival on the way she could get him booked in.  Still the dress was new.  I pale cream colored dress in the modern style.

Harry moved forward a few steps then stopped, marveling at how kind the light was to her right now.  She looked...  He sat down across from her, suddenly nervous.

"Be--" he tried, then stopped as he choked.  He started again.  "Bess, I did not expect to find you here."

Her head was down, hair covering her face slightly.  Harry waited.  After a moment, he tried again.  "I have been meaning to call on you.  Once I heard you were here.  Not here, but here in New York."

Slowly, Bess lifted her head.  Cold, blue eyes stared into his and Harry realized it was Bess, but also was not.  "Harry," she said, her voice a low, rasping whisper.  Suddenly, she collapsed almost in on herself and water splashed everywhere.

"Harry?"

Harry looked around.  Arthur was standing beside him.  "Are you all right?"

Harry looked around and felt his clothes.  Everything was dry.  "I...yes," he said.  "Is it time?"

Arthur nodded, concern in his face.  "Are you all right?" he asked again, more slowly.

Harry stood.  The table, of course, was empty as he had known it would be.  "Right as rain.  Let's go see your medium."
