Bess watched as the new girl twisted the thick chain around her husband and pressed the padlock through the links, securing it. The brightly dressed girl made a show of inserting a large key into the padlock and turning it. From the audience, Bess watched her for the slightest hint of flirtation or overtones of sexuality in her posture or gesture. There was none. Nothing except the brilliant white smile as the girl waved the key around then dropped it into a silk sack.

From the seat beside Bess, Robert groaned. “I hate this one,” he said.

“The girl?” Bess asked, though she knew the answer.

“The trick,” Robert grumbled. “It’s always this trick with him now.”

On stage, the girl helped Bess’s husband into a large, cylindrical copper tank. It would be filled with water Bess knew. She hoped it was witheringly cold.  She would have made it cold.

“It is his magnum opus,” Bess said.  There was no scorn or irony in her voice, but then she had practiced that for a long time.

“Two died trying it, did you hear?"  Robert took out a handkerchief and took his spectacles off to clean them but he kept his eyes squinting at the stage. "Drowned. Before they could get them out."

Bess could see her husband trying to scan the audience through the footlights until he disappeared behind the lip of the top of the tank.  The girl closed the lid and put another lock onto it and then stepped back with her arms raised.

"They were together?" Bess asked.

Robert looked over, confused, then remembered his earlier statement.  He turned his eyes back to the stage.  "Different towns."

On stage, the girl had flipped over a large, sand-filled hour glass.  She paraded around it.  Bess admired the grace with which the girl moved.  She was very fetching.  Bess tried to ignore the part of her that hoped the girl would trip and fall into the orchestra pit or the foot lights...face first.

"Together would be something," Robert smiled, but Bess noticed that his hands were gripping the edges of his seat.  "One come out dead, other come out alive.  That would be something."

Bess counted silently.  The sand grains could be controlled by a secret lever to move faster or slower, though the assistant had to be able to press down on the switch with her high heels.  The girl was not near her husband's lavishly decorated trunk so either she did not know about the switch or did not see a need for it yet.  Her smile was impeccable.

After a few moments, Robert looked over at Bess.  "He ever tell you what he thinks about while he is in there?"

The girl began inching back towards the trunk.  Bess could see a slight beading of sweat on the girl's forehead as her left heel slowly tried to find the switch.

Bess said.  "He thinks about dying in a water-filled tank, wrapped in chains."

"Ah," Robert said.
