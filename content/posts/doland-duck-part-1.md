It could be stated with a reasonable level of accuracy that most people in the town hated Michelle. Her piercing gaze seemed to capture each of their basest fears and insecurities. She could spit those back like machine gun bullets into a person's face as insults. Some people did not even know they had such deep seated issues until they wound up on the wrong side of Michelle's biting insults.

Doland was one of those people. He was something of a local celebrity and he had incorrectly assumed that status gave him immunity from the petty concerns of other town folk. As long as anyone could remember the Ducks (pronounced 'dukes') had been among the most important families in town. They were Water Walkers.

Legend and lore had it that in the early 1850's, Cohen Doland Duck (the 1st) had been coming home after a night of inebriated stargazing when he discovered a small fire hydrant in the center of town. He discovered it by falling over it and breaking his leg. His pleas for help were eventually answered a few hours later when the sun began to rise into the sky. (Cohen Duck--still pronounced 'Duke'--had taken quite a few tumbles over the years after a night of stargazing so the 5 hour delayed response time by his fellow citizens while uncomfortable was not unexpected). Much to the shock of Cohen's reluctant rescuers he had tripped on something that had never been in that spot before.

About six feet from the odd little statue in the town square a fire hydrant had mysteriously popped up. Fire hydrants we're not unheard of in the bigger cities like Philadelphia and New York but they had definitely not made it out this far west in those days. The town was mystified for months. The hydrant had no visible manufacturer or other identifying marks. Frannie Smythe, the town librarian, found a picture of a similar one in a book she borrowed from the State Library but even that one had markings.

Eventually the volunteer Fire Department got up the courage to turn it on. To everyone's surprise it worked. There was no known piping in the area around the town square yet there it was clear as day--crystal blue water streaming out when the Department turned the release bolt.

It was not until 1878 that the Ducks (still pronounced 'Dukes') came into the Hydrant legend again. Drought had come once or twice to the area and somewhere along the way one of the town's more industrious mayors had realized that they could sell the excess hydrant water to stricken towns around the state that were not weathering well. Over time this grew into a fairly large industry, the bottling of water in barrels and shipping them out. That is until the hydrant disappeared.
