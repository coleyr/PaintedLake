It is a peculiar thing for a man to live in a salt shaker. Normally persons prefer to live in far larger structures with roofs without little holes in them. Even though he didn't choose to live there he made the best of it, piling salt into a a circular igloo like shape similar to ones he had seen in national geographic. The roof of the salt circle was impossible to get just right but it didn't ever rain in the storage cabinet and usually Bethany remembered to turn off the lights when she locked up.

She was sweet and air headed always giggling. Whenever Johny came in to order coffee and smoke, Bethany frequently came skipping into the store room. She would put her knuckle in her mouth and squeal then turn heal with some napkins or straws to carry back and forth. Griffin would lean to the edge of the salt shaker and shake his head, "That silly girl" He thought. He liked watching her skip around. Mrs. Josie made a habit of swinging the door open to shake her head at Bethany as she danced around in the store room. She would hand her a broom and click her teeth. This small drama unfolded with only a man in a salt shaker to appreciate it. Josie protected Bethany, she was once carefree and prone to falling for one young man after another.

Josie's son often came to the storeroom with his skinny friend to play board games or cards. Griffin tried yelling "Don't move there!" But Rodney couldn't hear and moved his piece setting up a triple jump. The Skinny friend smiled. Neither of them could hear him and he was too small to rock his container from one place to another. It was frustrating watching Rodney playing the same game every time. Griffin found himself shaking his head, "that boy" he thought.

Griffin's home was behind a row of other shakers and the Josie's Diner had a terrible restocking policy where new shakers were added to the front row. It didn't really bother Griffin at first but after months of being in the same spot it occupied more and more of his mind. "What a silly system! Why doesn't anyone properly stock. It is not that hard a concept." The chances of going to a table meant he could potentially be noticed and maybe someone would eventually unscrew the lid and release him from his home.

Late at night his capture would come check in and clink on the glass shaker waking Griffin. A grinning face gazed a few moments to be completely sure Josie's hadn't corrected their terrible stocking methods and freed Griffin. Sometimes Griffin rolled out of his crystalline igloo to chat. Greenville was his capture but it was nice to chat with someone. Mostly they talked about the weather and Cousin gossip.

"Looks sunny from in hear" Griffin said warmly to dark room after feeling a thud on the shaker.

"It's not, overcast for over a week" A grumbly voice answered.

"Well it was quite nice in here" Griffin said plopping down on a salt bench.

"I quite like you in there too" The voice said then thumped the glass again before turning to leave.

"Have a good night" Griffin said rolling back over to go back to sleep.
