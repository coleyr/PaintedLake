Just outside of town is a small Inn. The sign read's 'No Vacancy' in bright red neon. Miss James works the counter and maintains the front garden which consists of two brick planters extending into the waves of cracked asphalt. Built in 1818 the Inn was just named The Inn because it was the only Inn for fifty miles and people back then lacked for creativity. On the east side of the lot, where it is unpaved and gravel, there are still two hitching posts. It is said, by some imaginative folk, that Andrew Jackson came to have an affair at the Inn and tied his horse to one of those hitching posts. The lesser known person who had once tied a horse to those posts caught a presidential bullet in a duel after threatening a damning expose. Some say that the Inn's location is technically Palletstown, but they are not listened to. All that about history happening in the front of this Inn may give the impression of some import, but it wasn't actually Jackson it was Millard Filmore and he just watched the duel.

This place is a milestone to some but not to do with regular history. Every few years, based on changing Sumerian lunar cycles, a group of Cousins come and stay at the Inn. They rent all six rooms and raise hell for two months or so. Miss James is out every morning sweeping broken glass and spraying down the odd firespot with her garden can. On occasion Miss James would wake up at night to a bright silver light. On such nights she would light a cigarette pour into her Chevy and drive two miles down the road with the moon so near she thought she might touch it. A few harsh words and empty threats between hacking coughs and then boys would shut it down and turn towards bed. She would crank up the Skinnard and ride towards home with the moon back hiding far away behind clouds. It was on a night such as this she unleashed a particularly foul mouthed tongue lashing.

"Shit she about hexed you Thrumble" A tall dark razor thin man chuckled.

"Hmph, water drinken coward, she stayed we woulda had words" A grumbly voice grumbled shaking the pebbles of the dimly lit lot.

"I am fairly certain not but a few people can even make out the meaning of your words"  Said a short leathery man with long dark hair.

Thrumble grumbled but it was too low a frequency to hear save a few confused elephants at the zoo a hundred miles away.

"Wanna try this, I made it with bumblejack and kaka beans. Take a drink and pass it."  The thin man said reaching into the back of his Olds Mobile retrieved a large glass flagon and poured some of the contents into the cups. The six drank a large gulp and handed the mug to the person across from them. "Dremamewa" the thin man said waving his hand over the outstretched tankards. Another gulp.

"You son of a bitch! You slept with Willomena!?" Said a portly monk looking man half upset half laughing. The long haired man sank into a wry smile.

"Oh we got one! Mine is floating above the trees on a summers night. Scared congregants down below." The long haired man reminisced pushing back his straight silky locks from his face.

"What'd you get Minty?" The long thin dark man said in an excited whisper.

"Mine is, what appears to be uh, field, or meadow, bunch of bottles and some cut wheat. Oh this is a sacrifice, ok, I see it. Ah! What!" Minty jumped and tumbled to the ground covering his face with his hands. He panted as he saw cursed metal objects pointing towards him. He slowly came too and saw the men laughing and rolling on the ground.

"Haha very funny, whatha hell was that Zee?" He said pulling himself off the ground.

"Fuckin priests, got it in their heads my bones could cure one of the plagues." Zee said between sharp inhales of laughter. "Y'know they read it in some damn book, and I come to find out it was a cousin who gave it to em."

"That's one hell of a memory Zee, why the hell did ya wanna share that?" Said Minty in a nasally whistle.

"Wanted to see what those stupid fucking priests saw, pretty funny if you ask me. I hope they thought so, was the last thing they saw this side of things." The thin man smiled sharply.

" Oh, gev it to meh , you like that , wanna add more? " A voice low and suddenly sultry voice said.

"Oh boy, what memory did you give him Oggear?" The monkish man asked watching Thrumble drool a bit while gripping the corner of Zee's Olds Mobile gyrating and licking.

"Summer of 1972, Miami, first year of Doc J. G. Evers commune. I swear I gave that man real powers just to keep the pleasure cruise running. Gave thrumble the whole year, he may be out her till James comes and sweeps him up!" Said Oggear with wide eyes cheerfully.

A few side glances and then Zee grabbed the cork and pulled it with his teeth. "To Dr. Evers" He said as he poured another round and everyone passed their mugs to Oggear to sip.
