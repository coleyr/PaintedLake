Sometimes when you look at someone for a while and really look at them you start to think, who is this person? Michael squinted, analyzing the odd cadence with which she chewed her chicken wrap. He was hoping for some wave of memory to wash over him and fill out this relationship. What he really wanted in that moment was a name. Jane maybe? No, that was the name of the Ellory's aunt who came for thanksgiving but didn't eat anything. Who does that? It could have been a boys name, there was some swirling feeling about someone with a boys name. Charlie? Michael was pretty sure that was on his mind since Zeb had been testing new middle names to claim he had. Why does anyone care about their middle name? It is weird he kept trying to tell us it was something different every week, Allison started writing them down. Zebediah Neal Henry Charlie Ostrich Chauncy Flame Web Dunkin Burger.

The girl across the table looked up and smiled, mouth full of tortilla and chicken. Michael was tired and was having a hard time landing anywhere certain. It is like when you wake up from a dream where you are at a theme park and there is a split second where your brain is in between where you were and where it thinks you are. He felt like he was on the beach with Ellory. The wind blowing and Bailey panting as the three of them watched the sun set. Michael was a few moments ago reveling in this very fine moment when a total stranger surprised him in the cafeteria by covering his eyes and planting a kiss on him the moment he hurriedly turned around. She tasted a little like a Maddie, but he knew he had better stick to pronouns to be safe.

"Whatya wanna do today?" She said in a bubbly tone. Why can't someone come say hello so and so, funny seeing you here.

"Well, what would you like to do?" Michael arrived at the end of that basic sentence feeling proud of how he navigated.

"I asked you first, but, I was thinking maybe you would wanna back to where we were last night and ya know hang out there for a bit?" She bit her lower lip and grinned. At this moment Michael was both confused and clandestinely excited by whatever the hell he did last night. Why did I pick this person, I know why she picked me. I am good looking and funny. But what did I see in her? She is pretty but this lunch has been dull. Perhaps my fault, she sounds engaging and playful. Also what the hell in my past did I change to get here? Oh my goodness what if we have been together for a long time. Don't panic but look at her hand, any rings? phew ok. So much to think about, I want to tell Ellory about this she would think it is a riot. But I can't right now. I am trapped moving through this series of events. Here for reasons I don't know. It feels like tension. Michael closed his eyes. I am here for a moment he thought. All this confusion is OK, after all I am sharing this moment with a stranger I could be in love with, that is not a new feeling.

"Ugh, you ok?" The girl asked.

Michael opened his eyes. "Yeah, I am. Sorry, you ready to go enjoy the evening?" Michael said smiling. Katherine with a "k" he thought, I am pretty sure that's it.

"Yeah, sure thing, let me put my tray away." The two walked over to the conveyor where she they set their plates.

"I am glad to be with you" Said Michael extending his hand. The two smiled.

"I am glad to be with you too" said Quasimodo.
