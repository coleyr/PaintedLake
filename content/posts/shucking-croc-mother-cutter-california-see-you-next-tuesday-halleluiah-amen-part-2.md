E. was sitting at the kitchen table doing his homework.  He father was sitting across from him reading the evening paper's sport section, eating a sandwich. E.'s mother was packing his and his father's lunches for the week.

he and his family had celebrated his birthday that night.  18 G.D. years old.  At dinner, E. had told his parents about the lists of curse words he had put together over the years and how he had planned to wake them up to him reading through all of them.  His parents had gotten a good laugh out of that and asked him to at least wait until after breakfast tomorrow.

"Did you mow the Netane's lawn, Quentin?"

"What?" Quentin said, looking up.

E.'s mother paused from slicing the sandwiches she was working on.  "I ran into Lana at the store and she asked me to thank you but to tell you not to worry about doing it in the future since she was going to purchase her own lawn mower."  E. looked over at his mother.  She was doing that thing where she was smiling but really not smiling.

Quentin Longstreet sunk a little in his chair.  "Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was out getting the garbage cans in and noticed how bad her lawn was looking."  E.'s mother said nothing, but her smile somehow got bigger.  "Just trying to keep the neighborhood's property value's up," his father finished weakly.

E.'s mother looked over at him.  "Since you do our lawn, E., you won't mind picking up Lana's as well, will you, dear?"

E. looked at his father then mother.  "Will that increase my allow--?"  E.'s mother's smile dropped.  "Or I could just do it to, to keep the property values up."  E.'s mother's smile returned.

"Wonderful.  And Lana can probably figure out how to get her own garbage cans in from the curb, Quen.  Don't you think?" E. looked at his notebooks of curse words and...other stuff.  He could not believe that his life long obsession had been to curse his parents out on his 18th birthday.  It seemed beyond juvenile; it seemed...sad.  E. looked around.

"Damn titty penis poop," he said softly, then looked around again.  "Damn--"

"E., are you out there?" his mother called from inside.  E. jumped.  Had she heard him?!? Oh, gosh, oh gosh! "What, yeah, coming," he said as he lifted the lid of the can, started to toss the journals in then realized they were Ms. Upskirt's garbage cans.

"Holy fried bananas, dad!" he muttered, realizing how close to a SNAGU (System Normal All Gummed Up) he had come.  If those had gone in Ms. Knocker's ta-tas...and what if she had found them while she was rooting around in there with a miniskirt on, something tasteful but that had been shrunk in the wash without her realizing it?  E. did not even want to think what would have happened if he hadn't noticed he had his hands on Ms. Supple's cans.  He opened his family's garbage cans and thrust the journals in.  Then he dashed inside. The morning of his 18th birthday did not bring the long sought after cursing monologue the younger E.'s had dreamed of.  E. slept in.  It was noon before his mother poked her head into his room and asked if he planned to sleep the next 18 years away.

"No, mom," E. said, rolling out of bed.

"Good," she said.  "I left your fucking breakfast on the table so you may need to warm it up."  Then she left.

E. stared after her, his mouth wide open.  Slowly he stood up and shook his head to clear it.  He pinched his arm slightly, waiting.  When he did not sprout antlers and no cartoon characters walked into the room he decided he was not dreaming and he had just misheard his mother.  Still....

"Mom, you feeling okay?" he called after her.

"Yes," she called back up the stairs.

E. pulled on a most likely clean shirt and definitely clean pair of shorts.  He went downstairs to the kitchen and grabbed himself some orange juice from the fridge.  His mom was at the sink, finishing up the breakfast dishes.

"Mom, did you, upstairs did you, say...um."  E. sat down.

"Yes, I told you that you would need to heat up your own breakfast.  I am doing the dishes now and you slept all morning and I do not have time," his mother said.

E. held up his hand.  "Okay, okay.  I wasn't asking about that.  I was--forget it."

E.'s father came in from the garage.  He was dressed in his factory uniform.  "How's that mostly firm ass hanging?" Quentin asked, as he swatted his wife on the bottom.  E.'s mother gave her husband a kiss on the cheek.

"Dad," E. said, shocked. "What are you doing?!?"

Quentin Longstreet looked over at his son.  "Sorry, E.  Management all have their thumb up each other's asses down at the water plant.  All Hands on Dick emergency this morning."

E. stared in horror at his father.

His father held up his hands.  "E., I am sorry.  I know it's your birthday.  I will make it up to you.  We'll go out and score some blow and hookers when I get back."

E. shot to his feet.  "Drugs?  Prostitutes?  What the--what the--what the heck, Dad!?:

E.'s mother spun around.  E.'s father looked like E. had slapped him.  They both looked at each other.  "E.," his father said slowly.  "I know you are upset.  I know you are 18 and feeling your oats a little this morning.  But you are still under my roof and profanity is not any more acceptable today than it was yesterday."

E.'s jaw dropped.  "Dad, you just popped mom on her bottom, asked about it, then told me we would get hookers and drugs tonight when you got home."

E.'s mother and father looked at each other.  "And..." his father said.

E. stared at the two, waiting.
