E"Doyle!"

Someone was shaking his leg. Doyle blinked rapidly in a vain attempt to clear his eyes. He could make out the shape of a woman's silhouette in the darkness.

"There is money in the nightstand, love." Doyle started to roll over when a hand slapped his cheek hard. He bolted to a sitting position with his fists up. The silhouette crossed its arms and waited. After a moment, Doyle rubbed his jaw tentatively.

"Bess," he said. It was not a question.

"Yes." Bess lit a lamp.

"Farm girls," Doyle muttered. "None of the jokes about the farmer's daughter ever mentioned her sucker punching a half-asleep bloke in the dark."

Bess arched an eyebrow and took a step forward. "You look awake now."

Doyle chuckled and quickly raised his hands in surrender. "You carry the day, love. I apologize." Bess appeared quite slight but that and her voluminous dresses tended to hide her strength. Doyle suspected more than one Iowa farm boy in her hometown was missing teeth.

She sighed with frustration. "Why do you always make me want to fight, Doyle? You bring me war and Harry brought me peace."

"Harry nearly sawed you in half once--"

"Harry told me about your medium," she said suddenly as if she were afraid the words would hide inside if she did not get them out at that exact moment.

Doyle said nothing for a long while. They stared at each other.

"She is not my medium, Bess," he said eventually.

"You took Harry to meet her. To her seance." Bess crossed her arms. "How could you, Doyle?"

The accusation stung more than when she had slapped him.

"Yes," he said. He could see her trying to hide her knuckles as she reflexively squeezed them into fists.

Doyle gestured towards the far edge of the bed. Bess started to object then sat down primly on the edge. He leaned back and spread his hands wide.

"How could I know she was what she said she was, Bess?"

"So you believe in her?" Bess spit the words at him. "She can see the past? Speak to the...to the..."

"The dead, yes." Doyle did not pull many punches. He suspected that was why Bess was here. She processed the words then looked away.

"Have you spoken to--"

"No, not her," Doyle said. "Only someone I knew from the war. A German. We are hoping he can find Adele."

"You are hiring a dead detective? A death detective?" Bess seemed to taste the words. She almost smirked.

"Mayhap." Doyle searched his nightstand for one of his cigars. "He was a soldier, not a detective. Farmer or mechanic before the War, maybe." He found one and lit it.

"On your side?"

Doyle shook his head.

Bess stood up suddenly and walked to the window. Nearby a train was passing. She wondered where it was going. Anywhere but here and now, she thought.

"Why now?" Bess asked. She kept her back to Doyle so that he could not see the betraying tears that slipped down her cheeks. She is stronger than most of the boys we shipped into the Kaiser's meat grinder , Doyle thought. You can barely see her shoulder shaking. An old boxing instructor had told him once that the shoulders and hips held every opponent's secrets.

He gave her time to collect herself. Eventually he said, "I do not understand the question, love."

Bess spun around, her eyes flashing with rage. "You understand exactly what I mean, Arthur Doyle!"

Doyle smoked his cigar. Then he inclined his head in a slight nod. "I think our medium did not expect she could ever actually do what she purported to her clients."

"I want to meet her," Bess said.

Doyle sat up, spluttering. "Ah...". The cigar fell from his lips and he scrambled in the sheets and his bed clothes to find it.

"Arrange it," Bess opened the bedroom door just as he found the cigar and stamped it out against the night stand.

"Fine," Doyle yelled after her. "How did you get in by the by?"

"Either one of your whores or your cleaning lady let me in,". Bess called from the other room. "She did not clarify which and I did not ask."

He heard the front door open and close. He could just make out Bess' light tread on the stairs outside his apartment.

"Damn," Doyle said. He reached over and pulled open the nightstand. "Whore," he said.

He laid back down to sleep again then reached into his pocket for his wallet. It felt lighter than he remembered. "Maid," he said in disgust. Then he smiled. "Maybe both."
