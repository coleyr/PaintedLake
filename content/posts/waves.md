Rodney looked over at Dan pointing his eyes towards the front of the classroom. Dan was starring at the back of Michelle's head almost drooling. Dan wasn't the only one starring at Michelle, she had attracted a lot more attention since her cup size double. Dan was leaning forward to see her outline when a balled-up piece of paper struck him in the temple.

"Hey jackass" Rodney whisper yelled a few rows over.

"What" Dan said suddenly no longer at a fantasy sleepover with too few beds and too many wine coolers. Rodney looked towards Dan then up to the front of the classroom then back to Dan then back. "What?" Dan said.

"Look at Ms. Joans" He exhaled through his teeth. Dan squinted and looked at Ms. Joans who was erasing an algebra problem with a pudgy fist.

"I will help you later Rodney" Dan said petulantly, he couldn't believe he was called away from imaginary Michelle inviting Dan to share a slim bed, the smell of wine-cooler and perfume, oohhh she was so cold and so r-

Â 

"No, not the problem, look at Ms. Joans" Rodney said his eyes bulging above his gritted teeth. Ms. Joans was so forgettable a person that Dan realized he didn't really know what she looked like, sure he had been in her class for two years but she was so plain she was practically invisible. Dan studied the portly stout woman wearing a jean dress with cross-sections of little quilted squares. Her dress hung down straight on either side making her look like a five-foot rectangle with a frizzy and ruddy-faced afixed to one end.

She squawked " Alright, now we went over this last week, but I think I will go over it again because the quiz grades were ... disappointing." She looked over at Rodney who was still looking to Dan for some reaction.

"Mr. Wrathbine, let's pay attention this time." Rodney looked up to her then back at Dan with an excited expression. Dan stared back blankly. He then looked at Michelle and pointed at Ms. Joans. Michelle shook her head and mouthed the word "what" but somehow with a tone even though it was silent. Rodney rolled his eyes.

"How about I do the equation this time?" Rodney said. Ms. Joans would have been suprised but twenty years of education had dulled her in all ways. It was the first time anyone besides Sydney Winters volunteered for a problem Ms. Joans chortled, set the chalk and shuffled over to her desk chair. Rodney walked briskly then turned towards the classroom at an angle and hurridly pointed at Ms. Joans and raised his hand pretending to be holding some object which he brought down again and again while forming some shape with his mouth that was either open-mouthed opera singing or some phallic imagery.

"Mr. Wrathbine, the problem on the board." Ms. Joans said shortly. Rodney looked to Dan and Michelle who were really bad at gestures and both nodding their heads in confusion. Rodney exhaled and turned towards the board. Ms. Joans took out a stack of graham crackers to munch on and chewed loudly while crumbs tumbled down her dress. She starred out the window not even looking at the board. Rodney turned to see her blank expression and quickly drew an arrow point to the block of a woman. Rodney wrote at one end of the arrow "cult". Dan and Michelle's eyes grew wide and they looked to each other then back to Rodney. The rest of the class looked confused except for Sydney who excitedly shot her hand in the air to tell on Rodney. Ms. Joans who had been conditioned to expect tattling when she saw the meanest looking girl with pigtails raise her hand snapped out of her munching trance. Rodney had to think fast before she saw what he had written. He quickly added a hump to the "l" on the board and sighed with relief as Ms. Joans began to squawk and pull out a referral.
