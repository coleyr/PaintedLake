Ellory hated the rain, it was an unwelcome interruption to a day of play preplanned fun in the sunshine. She envisioned swinging on the tire swing and playing kickball with Michael and Evan in the sandy field. Now the tire swing is filling on the bottom half with big thick droplets and the field is muddy and filled with grassy puddles. She stood staring out the window gritting her teeth and mentally urging the blue gray skies to leave. She heard her mother softly knocking on her bedroom door.

"Go away" She said, adjusting slightly which made her realize she was still holding her left shoe. She had been in the middle of getting dressed for the park when the skies opened up. "Hey El, Michael and your cousin is here" Barbara said poking her nose just past the door. "Why?" Ellory said tossing her shoe into the her laundry bin. "To play silly, I thought you could make a fort downstairs or Michael said he brought the mousetrap board game" Barb explained peering into the room past the door. Ellory nodded and uncrossed her arms turning towards the door. She shot a glance back at the window speckled with rain. She grumbled and pushed her thumb to her nose.

"Hiya El, look at this, it is a little net." Evan said pushing a plastic yellow net on a notched plastic pole.

"That's cool Evan, hey Michael" Ellory huffed stomping down the stairs. Michael had a thousand yard stare and was holding the kitchen chair with a clench hand. Ellory repeated "Hey Michael". He just blinked and wobbled. He has been doing that for a few minutes, he was telling me how to play and then stopped." Evan said moving the mouse pieces to the start block. "Hey E... He... Hey Wel.. Hey Ellory" Michael stammered wobbling a bit. "Hey" Ellory said not to be put off her sour mood by Michael's inconsistencies. "Bailey" Michael shouted leaning down to pick up the tiny pup. Bailey wagged her tail and shook her butt in excitement.

"Well you wanna play your game?" Ellory said sharply.

"Yeah" Evan giggled holding to of the mice end to end.

"I was talking to Michael." Ellory stated flatly.

Michael peered over the table to see what he had brought. Mousetrap, yuck, a game of no strategy just all determining dice rolls.

"We could play a more...skilled game maybe like go fish or something." Michael squeaked.

"Why did you bring mousetrap then?" Evan demanded.

"Don't be rude Evan! But yeah why did you bring it? And it is skilled you have to avoid the nets and be good with your rolls." Ellory said pointing to a brightly colored plastic mousetrap.

"Well uhm, that you can't really be good with rolls, it's just luck. I guess I changed my mind, it is just kind of a crappy game." Michael said. Ellory and Evan gasped. Barbara peered into the kitchen from her perch on the sofa.

"Don't say the C word" Evan said sharply looking back and forth between Michael and Barbara. He wanted to separate himself from the crime and if there was a report to Daphne, he wanted his objection on the record.

"I didn't say cu...nd't play mousetrap. I mean ok, I won't say the C word, but yes also let's play mousetrap."

"Ok, I will roll first" Evan said over eager grabbing the dice and slinging them across the board.

Ellory sat down and started to let Michael's inconsistencies throw her off her sour mood.
