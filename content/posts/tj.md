T.J. was a bully.

Everyone knew it and everyone tried to stay out of his way.  But he was like this force of nature that you knew was there but never knew when it would strike.

Months would go by without an incident then T.J. would be walking down the hall, decide he did not like someone's face and they would find themselves slammed into a bank of lockers.

Any other kid in the school--in any school--would have been kicked out of school by then.  But T.J. was very big and very, very strong.  In football he basically was the offensive line, in basketball he just stood under the basket and pushed kids away from it.  There are no kings and queens in America, but never doubt the presence of royalty.  Sports stars, rock stars, movie stars all live by a different code and as long as T.J. kept the town in trophies a few students with bloody noses and bruises was just collateral damage.

"I know it is him," Michelle said, holding up a card that said "T.J."

Daniel, Rodney and Michelle were gathered around a pegboard.  Names and times had been written on 3x5 index cards.  Most were scattered across the desk, a few were up on the board.

Rodney ignored Michelle and gazed up at the board.

"Did you hear me, genius?" Michelle asked, poking Rodney.  He ignored her.

She poked Daniel in the shoulder. "Revenge of the Nerds, did you hear me?"

"Ouch!" He squeaked.  Daniel rubbed his arm.  "People can die from that, you know!  Blood clots happen all the time and it does not take much pressure to kill someone."

Michelle rolled her eyes.  She turned back to Rodney.  "Do you have anything to add?  You have been staring at that board for an hour.  Is this really what you guys do all day?"

"We do other stuff, too," Daniel said defensively.  He shot a furtive glance at the Clue game box wedged partially under the table in the back of the room.

"Whatever," Michelle sighed.  "Since Stoner Bob here is checked out maybe you can tell me why we are bothering with all this l, Danny Boy."  She flopped the card onto the table beneath the peg board.  "You are supposed to be helping me get proof that T.J. killed Sarah."

"Actually we are trying to figure out who did it, Michelle," Rodney said.  "You asked us to do that."

Rodney turned to her.  "People think I don't pay attention but I--wait I thought you said something about snacks."

"Yeah, I lied," Michelle said.  "So back to T.J. How can we prove he did it."

"We need to establish a pattern of behavior," Daniel said.  "Rule out his alibis, find the murder weapon, location of the crime."

"Are you reading this off the back of a Clue game box or something?" Michelle asked.  "I know all of that.  That is cop show 101.  What are you going to do?"  Michelle asked, enunciating her last three words.

"Okay, maybe let's start with an alibi," Daniel said.  "We can rule out any alibis like staying with a friend or stuff like that.  Then when we--um, to that point, we're, um, we planning on confronting T.J.?  Like by ourselves?"

"I don't want to die," Rodney said.

Michelle threw up her hands in frustration.  "I wouldn't expect a couple of dorks who sit around playing board games--yes I can see the Clue box you are trying not to look at, Daniel.  I wouldn't expect you dorks to do the hero stuff.  Just get proof so I can make the cops listen."

"Sounds like a good idea to me," said a voice behind them.  They turned to find T.J. standing in the doorway.  He took a step into the room...and kicked over a desk.  It slammed into the wall.  Everyone including T.J. Stared at it.

"Oh..." said Daniel.

"...crap," finished Rodney.
