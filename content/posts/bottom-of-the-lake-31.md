"My dears, let me make my meaning clear. I am not asking you to move. I am telling you to step aside before my man kicks this door in. I do not want to catch you two with it."

Doyle's driver held his hand against hand against the door easily keeping it open even though two of the female valets inside struggled to push it closed.

He raised an eyebrow at Doyle.

"Let's give diplomacy another moment before violence," Doyle said to him.

"We have sent someone for help!" One of the valets yelled.

"Police or Bruisers?" Doyle said. "I am on excellent terms with the bosses of both in this district."

Harry stepped forward. "Mademoiselles, you are dressed as men. You are in league with a fraud. Should the police arrive they will take you both in custody to the men's facilities and it will be some time before they turn out the truth of your situation."

There was a momentary pause then the struggle against the door increased voraciously to the point where Doyle's man had to push slightly harder.

Doyle scowled. "Your diplomacy skills are impeccable, Harry."

He nodded to his driver. "Kick it down but try not to damage the ladies."

The struggling against the door stopped. It opened. One of the valets stood framed in it, holding a lead candlestick.

"My lady has a derringer."

Doyle produced a large revolver from his jacket and held it out to the valet grip-first.

"Excellent.  Then she will know how to fire this.  She can borrow this while we are here to ensure our good manners."

The valet looked back into the room and then took the revolver between two finger. She handed it to someone behind the door and stepped aside slowly.

Doyle stepped in followed by the other two men. He handed his coat to the woman behind the door who instinctively started to lower the gun to take it then realized what she was doing.  Her cheeks flushed and she angrily raised the gun quickly.

Doyle gave her a wink and moved deeper into the parlor.

"Madame Evrelsa, where are you, my dear?"

The valets, not the one carrying Doyle's gun, stepped forward. "She has left through a bolt hole we have--"

"Enough!" Harry roared. Everyone, including Doyle, turned to look at him. Harry pointed at the valet. "You are Evresla. You have the same build and mannerisms. I assume you all take turns playing the medium to the marks. I do not care about that. I want to know what happened at that table tonight."

The valet stared at Harry then smiled wanly. "Perceptive. Yes, tonight it was me. But I do not know what you believe you saw or heard that would make you come into my home so forcefully. We are entertainers and illusionist like you, Mr. Houdini."

Harry's patience was fraying. He opened his mouth to speak but before he could the woman called Velsa sighed and gestured for the men to follow.  She handed the gun to Doyle.

"It isn't loaded, is it?"

Doyle tossed it to his driver. "It is not even real, my dear.  Still I would prefer we forgo any attempts at blunt force with the candle sticks."

"I'll s'ay 'ere," Doyle's driver said, slipping the pistol into his jacket pocket. "Yell if 'ou need me," he looked darkly at the valets around him. "I am real."  He looked over to Velsa.  "Mr. Doyle is a favorite around the Club. Mind not to damage him."

Madame Evrelsa, or Velsa, took them further into the parlor and then through a false door that even Harry's keen eyes had missed on their first visit.

Velsa and the other valet passed through a small sleeping chamber with five rough cots along the far wall. They stopped in front of a door with cryptic writing on it.  Harry peered closely at it while Velsa retrieved a key from her waist coat.

Doyle looked back at the cots.  "So, you, ladies, all--"

"Leave off, Doyle," Harry warned and Doyle leered at him.

Velsa opened the door and gestured for them to enter. Doyle and Harry peered inside to make sure it was not an abandoned elevator shaft or some other trick. The women did not seem like criminals but people did unexpected things when they felt backed into a corner.

Velsa groaned and pushed past them to step into the room. She twirled around to show them it was safe. She pulled a small camera off of a shelf and set it on a stand.

"That is what?" Doyle asked walking over to study it.

"A Soul Seer. It is what Spirits told me during the play to share with you both. Right before they asked me to kill you both."  She pulled a small derringer out of her pocket and pointed it at them.
