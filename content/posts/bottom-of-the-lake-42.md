Harry opened the door and bowed with a flourish, gesturing for Doyle to step inside.  "Adventure awaits the bold."

Doyle harrumphed again and stepped inside.

"Bloody Hell," he muttered.

Harry stepped after him and stopped in the doorway.  "Oh," he said.

Inside Velsa stood with the rest of her valets.  All were carrying various blunt instruments, a few held wicked looking daggers.  "Is that a mace?" Harry whispered to Doyle.

"Morning star," said one of the valets.

"Gentlemen, so good of you to join us," Velsa said.  "Please ask your valet to come in out of the cold."

Doyle poked his head out of the door and signaled to Dobbs.  A moment later, Dobbs crept in carefully then stopped short.  "Right," he said then stood up.  "Is that a--?"

"Morning star," Harry confirmed.  "Yes, it is."  Dobbs gave Harry an appraising look and nodded approvingly.

"I left my wallet here last night, Madame," Doyle began.

"And you were worried that a charlatan with no scruples like myself would pilfer it so you decided to come early, break in, search through my establishment until you found it and anything else of interest to you," Velsa said.

Doyle pursed his lips and shot a look at Harry.  "I suppose is a fairly weak excuse when you put it that way, isn't it, Harry."

Velsa tossed the lead pipe she was holding onto one of the couches.  "Please leave your valet and follow me."

Dobbs looked at the valets and smiled widely.

"Care to say anything menacing as I go to guarantee my safety?" Doyle grumbled as he and Harry followed Velsa.

"Right," Dobbs said, "Mr. Doyle's, um, , a, ah--"

"Never mind," Doyle muttered and left the room.

Dobbs turned back to Velsa's valets.  "You ladies play dice?" he asked conspiratorially.  Five hands shot forward, each with a set of dice in their palm.

"Right..." Dobbs said.
