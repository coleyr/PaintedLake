Michelle opened the three musketeers bar and threw the wrapper onto a pile of other candy wrappers.  Study fuel she said to herself taking a large bite of chocolate and nougat. She turned the news paper, Ms. Hollingsworth was closing her canning business on main street and some history guy came to town to visit the home of Doland Duck. What the hell, get a life nerd. Michelle scowled judged the mans square face. Another page turned, this one to lost and found. Someone had lost a cat, someone else lost book and a school grounds keeper found a bike. Michelle's eyes grew wide and she circled the posting with yellow sharpie.

"I wanna know what you would do when she ain't pretty no more? That is all she has Dan, and well we ain't gonna be this pretty forever" Rodney gestured towards his face like Vanna White unveiling vowel.

"Listen I think she is funny and well ya know spunky, she doesn't take crap from anyone." Dan started softly and uncertain but grew bolder confident in his explanation.

"Ah, see you don't know? A part of any good relationship is what I like to call 'squish'. 'Squish' is like being spongy you can absorb blows and bounce back, ya know recover. Some people have no squish, make one wrong move and these people turn hard. They get mad, they yell, they take life so seriously and make all bad things your fault for steppin outta line." Rodney gingerly pointed his toe feigning the slightest of steps. "So you can't be perfect all the time, right?" Rodney pointed as he spoke, Dan nodded sheepishly. "And she will hound you whenever you are not here deluded version of perfect because she has no squish" Rodney thought about how he had made such a great case Matlock himself would be proud. "Dude" Dan said defiantly, "I think she makes me want to be a better person and I just wanna talk to her all day."  Dan said in a dreamy stuper. Rodney's exhale and argument recovery was interrupted by the shrill ring of Dan's telephone. Dan walked over to the handset picked it up and rested in on his shoulder.

Before Dan could say hello a voice on the other end began speaking hurriedly.

"Dan?" Michelle said on the other line. Dan smiled.

"Oh, hi! How you are?" Dan fumbled excitedly. Rodney rolled his eyes.

"Never mind that, I got something, a bike was found on the Nelson high campus, I called they guy and told him it was mine. I am heading over there now, you and Rodney and TJ need to meet me there like yesterday." Michelle said sharply.

"Ok, uhm I know Rodney's not busy" Dan said watching Rodney squirt cheese from a can into his mouth. " I think TJ has practice until six, may..."

"Ok, perfect I will get TJ, you get Rodney. How fast can you get there? "

"We are on our way! Be there in ten minutes. See ya ..." Dan heard the dial tone and realized Michelle hung up.

"Ok, we gotta go!" Dan said to Rodney a coy smile on his stupid face.

"Whats she wearing? " Rodney said .

"What? Why do you wanna know? I thought you said you would rather date a literal cow?" Dan said defensively as he pulled on his jacket.

"I appreciate a very certain few of her anatomical assets. I can appreciate the olives on a crap sandwich." Rodney cupped his hands and looked at Dan who was digging for a flashlight in the drawer.

"Cmon" Dan said shortly tossing him a heavy flashlight.
