Harry was still under the water. She could see him through the glass struggling, really struggling. Everyone in the audience could see him. A few nervous laughs came from the gallery patrons but mostly people just sat staring, transfixed.

Like an execution, Bess thought.

"Bread and bloody circuses," Doyle muttered, echoing her thoughts. She did not think the pun was intentional. Doyle always swore when he was scared. Or angry. Or awake.

In the tank, Harry's movements became more frantic...

Harry looked around. He was soaking wet but no longer underwater. He was in a some sort of a stone room, no, it was a cave. There was movement off to Harry's left. Someone was gesturing.

"The German!" Harry said. "What are you--where am I?"

The man gestured more frantically for Harry to follow him. Harry took a tentative set towards the German then another. When he was close the German put out a hand. Harry noticed that it was blood stained and arms he peered closer in the dim light he realized the man was in full dress uniform and it was filthy and also blood stained.

Harry took the man's hand. The German closed breathed almost in a reluctant sigh and then the cave was gone and the world was chaos.

The man yanked Harry to the ground and pulled him behind some twisted metal pylons. Bullets ricocheted all around them. Explosions rocked the earth and all around them men tore at each other with swords and bayonet and pikes. Ten yards away a man in an ancient looking uniform fired a pistol into an enemy's face. Blood and brains splattered but a second later both men were run through with a long pike.

Harry watched in horror as the two looked down in unison then began pushing themselves off either end of the pipe.

"No die," the German said. "No die here ever. Just pain." He pulled Harry along a thin line of cover towards another opening in the ground.

The two fell into it right as a mortar went off above their heads. Bits of rock punched miniature holes in Harry's skin. He might have screamed but he could not distinguish his own from the screams and cries of pain around him.

The German pulled him deeper into the cave.

"What is this place!?!" Harry yelled over the din of battle above them.

"No lower Heaven, raise Hell," the German yelled back.

"Come you to her. Now!"

"My daughter?" Harry asked as the raced into the darkness. "She is here in THIS place?"

The man stopped abruptly and peered into Harry's eyes.

"I bring girl here," he said after a minute and turned back to the path, running now. "Only way. You take her back out." The man suddenly stopped and spun around. "You stay. You!" He poked a rough finger into Harry's chest. "Here," he waived a hand around, as if indicating the whole world. "In the place, she go to back out."

Harry considered for a moment. Then he thought of Bess and nodded his head. "Just take me to her."

Doyle's fist clenched and unclenched uncontrollably.

"Too long, too damn long," he said.

Harry's struggling had slowed in the glassed-in cage full of water. He was still moving though. How long could he hold his breath?

"I am going up there," Bess said. "Excuse me," she said trying to edge past the patron standing to her left. The seating rows and aisles were crowded as people moved closer or crained their necks to get a better view of the spectacle--magician dies in his signature trick. I was there!

"Excuse me," she said again pushed more firmly. Beside Bess's left ear a fist went flying by and crunched into the patron's jaw. The man went down instantly.

Then Doyle was in front of her tossing punches and shoving people out of his way. He was a bull in a rage and he tore mercilessly through the crowd of gawkers. Bess rushed to keep up not caring now who she stepped on.

"Harry," she yelled in the direction of the stage.

"Fire!" screamed Doyle. That broke the spell. The entire theater erupted in chaos as people streamed towards the exits, clawing and climbing over each other in their frantic flight.

Doyle was momentarily pushed back in the crush but Bess found it somehow easier to swim through the mass of bodies because of her smaller stature.

She made it to the stage and scrambled onto it. Harry's new assistant was banging on the side of the glass now. And she was holding the keys.

"The keys," Bess screamed. The girl ignored her and kept banging on the glass. Bess shoved her aside and grabbed the keys from her hand. She had memorized these keys and their locks, knew them each by touch after hours spent memorizing their every facet.

Bess pushed the first key into the lock and twisted. She forced herself to calm down. She worked by rote, opening the locks in reverse sequence.

Doyle was beside her, his hands pressed to the glass. "He is still alive."

Bess nodded. "Four minutes I think," she said. "He told me that once. Or maybe 40 minutes. Fourteen?"

She knew she was distracting herself, making this just another rehearsal.

Then the new assistant screamed. She pointed inside the glass. Bess looked up and dropped the keys. There was a small girl in the water with Harry. But she was not moving.

Harry stared out of the glass at Doyle and Bess. He opened his mouth to speak but his voice sounded strange. A hand struck him across the cheek. It was the German.

"Close mouth! Die if to do!" He shouted in Harry's face.

I am looking out of my own eyes, he thought. It was like looking through a tunnel. Then he eyes in his body in the tank looked down. Harry--both Harrys--saw what he was holding: a small girl. Then all Hell broke loose.

The earth above Harry was ripped away, revealing a blood red sky. Men and some women poured into through the gap above them. The German cursed and began kicking and punching and stabbing. Harry realized with horror and relief that the combatants were not coming for him specifically; the eternal War was just spilling over into their temporary refuge.

"Go her now! Her out! Go! Go!" The German yelled over the screams and howls of the enemy. He pointed down the pair of tunnels leading out of Harry's eyes and into the world of the living. Harry grabbed his daughter and, shielding her as best as he could, charged forward towards the murky vision in front of him.

Doyle and Bess both saw into Harry's eyes but they saw different things. Through Harry's pupils Bess could see another Harry running toward them somehow. He was carrying something. Doyle saw the German and the War raging around him. He saw all of the horror of the trenches behind the Harry running towards him.

"I don't--" Bess said but she was focused on Harry and what they could both see now was a girl Harry was carrying.

Something grabbed at Harry's shoulder and the Harry in the tank swayed backwards. The fight was starting to engulf Harry.

"God! He is not going to make it," Doyle said.

"Run, Harry!" Bess yelled, shoving her face into the glass. "Please!"

Doyle had seen war, had seen battle. He had done horrible things, seen them, and he knew Harry would not be able to outrun the War. No one could.

Then he saw something, someone in the fray behind Harry. For a moment the German's eyes locked with Doyle's. Everything slowed. The German smiled a wicked, challenging smile. Doyle made his decision.

Harry knew he was not going to make it. Something had his shoulder and now it had his leg. He screamed and pushed forward with all his might. Then he felt his daughter slip and he dove forward frantically reaching for her.

Something slammed into Harry--no, through him. Everything went dark and he waved his hands in the darkness, searching for his daughter.

For one brief moment it was all clear. Then Bess was choking, water streamed into her mouth. Everything around her was dark and murky. Slimy things grabbed at her ankles.

He was there suddenly. His arms around her and he pressed his lips to hers. He forced air into her lungs. She struggled willing him to stop, knowing instinctively what he was doing, but he was stronger than her, even now. He gripped her around her waist, set his feet and heaved upwards. Bess felt whatever had her legs rip off violently then she was floating upward. She reached for him but he only smiled and shifted his gaze to her left.

An arm snaked around her waist and yanked her upwards into the light. As she broke the surface of the water, sweet air flooded into her lungs.

"Mommie!" she yelled--

Bess stumbled and fell to her knees. Her fingers gripped...sand? "Mommie!" yelled...her daughter. And then she was there in Bess's arms.

Harry crawled onto the beach and sucked in a breath. "Doyle!" he panted.

"What?" Bess said. She hugged her daughter.

"Doyle went in after her!" Harry said. He stood up and looked around. "Where is he?!?"

Bess sat back heavily. "Doyle? He isn't here--Doyle?"

"Yes!" Harry said. "He went in after her," he gestured at their daughter. "Right before me."

Harry splashed into the water. "Doyle!" he screamed. He dove under the dark lake water and popped up a few feet away and dove back down again.

Bess looked down at her daughter and squeezed her into a hug. Something was off. Something felt wrong. Her daughter looked up and Bess saw it all in her eyes. Her older, haggard looking self outside of the glass, Doyle, older too, standing beside her. Both looking back at her. Old Doyle and her older self looked at each other and Bess saw a tenderness there that ripped at her heart.

From the lake, Harry screamed again for Doyle and dove under.

Older Doyle, on the other side of the glass disappeared, then she saw him standing in a sea of bodies and carnage. Hands reached up, dragging him down. Then he was back atop the pile, swinging some sharp weapon. He was covered in blood and had a wild look in his eyes. His locked on hers and he--he smiled.

"Glad I skipped the horses races," she heard in her head. Then her daughter blinked and the vision was gone.

Doyle climbed over the body he had just finished smashing to a pulp and looked up into the twilight.

"Is this where I think it is?" Doyle asked the man who had come up to stand beside him.

"Yes, no," the German said. "Come. Be morning soon. We rest."

Doyle pursed his lips. He was bleeding from a dozen wounds and part of his left arm below the elbow was missing. He held up the stump and frowned at it.

"Come," the German said. "I fight you with one hand back." He let out a cackle then slapped Doyle on the back.

"Not you here. Not right. Magician. For here," the German said. He had sat down on a small pile of clear ground and was patting his shirt looking for a pack of cigarettes.

"I am aware of that," Doyle said curtly. "Maybe I just like your company, you filthy Kraut."

"Maybe," the German laughed.

In spite of the pain, Doyle smiled too. He thought of the three of them: Bess and her daughter with their matching bright blue eyes and Harry, dark eyed and swarthy, his arms draped around them. Smiling. That memory had not been made at the lake, it had come from a few months before. But it was Doyle's memory and he clutched it close to his heart: the three things he loved most in this--in that--in any world.

"Come on, Blue Eyes," the German said to Doyle. "We find place to rest. Put picture away for tonight."
