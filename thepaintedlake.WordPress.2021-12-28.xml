		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There were certain constants in the town.

The fountain that fed the water industry just up and moved periodically.Â  No one knew why but at least once a generation the water bottling industry had to send out a Duck (pronounced "Duke") to find it by tripping over the fountain and breaking their leg.Â  It had appeared in a number of locations including--during one particularly odd decade--a brothel.Â  It had taken a while for the Duck family to find that one since at that time the only male Duck was the Reverend Josiah Duck.Â  And as he was like to announce from the pulpit every Sunday "the Reverend Josiah Duck did not take up with whores and miscreants lightly".

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Callowyn stared into her cup of coffee.Â  For hundreds of years people had sat in rundown hole-in-the-wall dives just like this and looked for answers in cheap plastic cups of the disgusting brown liquid.Â  There was some strange consolation in the thought.

"Tea leaves and coffeeÂ  beans," she said.Â  The virtual ordering screen popped up in front of her face, mistaking her speaking for the start of an order.Â  For some reason it made her smile.Â  She looked up and noticed the man two seats down the diner's counter was watching her.Â  The glare from the florescent lights made the plastic barriers between each turn-style seat shimmer slightly.Â  Callowyn realized her mask was retracted and reflexively brought a hand up to cover her mouth and nose.Â  It would have been more subtle to just disrobe and throw herself against the plastic barrier between them.

The man dipped his head slightly--nothing that would be noticeable to the other diners--in acknowledgement and turned away.Â  No flirting going on here, just a soul tired woman looking for answers, Callowyn thought.Â  Five years ago she might have taken a tumble with the guy to kill the boredom for a while.

Callowyn drained the really bad coffee in a single drink and pushed the empty cup and saucer towards the edge of the counter so a serving robot could collect and sanitize it for the next customer.Â  When she pulled up the virtual ordering screen it informed her that her coffee had been paid for already.Â  Callowyn looked over at the man two seats down.Â  He was watching futbol on the overhead.

"Hey," Callowyn said.Â  The man turned around and she nodded as she pulled her mask over her mouth and nose.Â  He stood and the two of them walked out of the diner.

"I don't live far from here," Callowyn said, "but you can't stay over.Â  I have to work tomorrow."

The man looked at her slightly perplexed and cocked his head.Â  After a few seconds, he blushed.Â  It made the black of his mask stand out.

I am really rusty, Callowyn thought.

"I..." the man said.Â  "I just wanted to ask you a few questions."

"Hey, science nerds!" Frechtel said from the hallway.

The hair on the back of Will's neck rose.Â  Beaks looked up at him from his workstation across the room.Â  Both instinctively checked the time.Â  Will could almost hear his co-worker's thoughts since the same were running through his head.Â  <em>A lot of labs on the floor...maybe just passing through...someone left donuts in the breakroom as a distraction...</em>

Frechtel stepped into their opened doorway.Â  Both men automatically put the pictures of their wives facedown on their desks as Frechtel sauntered into the room, spilling coffee out of an oversized mug as he did.Â Â The man somehow managed to combine the regal, cavalier air of Hugh Hefner in a smoking jacket with everyone you have ever wanted to punch in the face.

Will clicked closed his personal and work To-Do lists.Â  The former wyas officially a lost cause and the latter was officially on the ropes.Â  "Super busy today, Fretchel," he said, knowing it was a pointless statement.

"Super busy," Beaks echoed.Â  He was staring hard at his computer's screen, trying to not to make eye contact.

"You should be," the small man said absentmindedly as he scanned the leftovers of Beaks's breakfast.Â  "Are you going to eat that biscuit?"Â  Beaks pushed a half-wrapped sandwich towards Frechtel without looking up.

"You're not sick, right?" Frechtel said as he carefully unwrapped the sandwich, opening each flap and folding it down in a perfect crease.

"I feel like I am going to throw up right now," Beaks said but Frechtel was focused on juggling his newly pilfered sandwich, a half-eaten cinnamon bun (probably also pilfered), and his giant coffee mug.Â  A little of the coffee sloshed onto Beaks's desk, also unnoticed by Frechtel.

He and Beaks and their team were coming in overbudget and behind schedule--always a winning combination with top brass.Â  They were threatening to armchair quarterback the project for him and Beaks.Â  <em>Maybe they send Frechtel down to finish off the weak teams.Â  Thin the herd.</em>

"How was your weekend, Frechtel?" Will asked politely.

Frechtel half climbed, half jumped onto Beaks's desk and sat down.Â  He put his oversized coffee mug down on some of Beaks's papers and took another bite of his pilfered biscuit.Â  "If I remembered their names I would tell you, Willamenia," he said, his legs swinging slightly and hitting against the desk.

Will ground his teeth at the Frechtel's latest nickname.Â  He almost preferred last week's nickname.Â  Almost.Â  He had been Willamenia, Willyahelpme, Willyahelpher, Will.I.Am, Will.I.Ain't, Wilbur, Willing-and-Able, Strobo (Will had no clue where that one came from), Parker (also no clue), Silly Willy, Free Willy,Â  Wacky Will, Big Willie, Little Willie, Will E. Coyote (Frechtel was really proud of that one) and a few dozen others that luckily had stopped making the rounds in Frechtel's vocabulary.

Frechtel placed his biscuit down and wiped his hands on Beaks's desk.Â  He picked up his mug and swirled the coffee slowly like it was brandy. "What about you two losers?"

"You were training for a race, weren't you, Big Willy?" Beaks said with a smirk.

Frechtel looked at Will with interest.Â Â Will stared at Beaks. So that's how it was going to be. "Yes," Will said shortly.

Beaks was a good man, but good men broke under torture. Frechtel was bottled torture, aged to perfection and served with a side of stab-your-buddy-to-save-yourself.

"Which one?" Frechtel asked with feigned casualness.Â  "That donut run thing? Or one of your fraternity races?"

Will sighed.Â  "I am way past fraternities."

"But not sororities, amirite?"Â  Frechtel leered at him and did a sitting 'clubbing dance'.Â  He gave a high pitched laugh and slapped his leg.Â  After a few seconds of laughing his face grew serious.Â  "But it's your Greek stuff?Â  This race.Â  Spears and chicks in spandex and a lot of muddy guys."

"They're not in--," Will said then took a breath.Â  "It's just a regular race."

"Oh," Frechtel said, disappointed.Â  He liked exotic sounding activities.Â  According to him he had apparently done bungee jumping, sky diving, full contact chess and even even something called competitive canoe dancing.Â  "Mundane" sports did not interest the little accountant.Â  Then he shrugged. "When do you run--"

"I'm running it with my wife," Will added.Â  The second it was out of his mouth he knew he had made a mistake, a Grade-A rookie mistake.Â  Frechtel's eye's lit up and Beaks look up, smiling broadly--he had just gotten his morning back.

The little man hopped down from Beaks's desk and sauntered over to Will's, the half-eaten biscuit completely forgotten and abandoned.Â  "She's been after you for a while to get me over for dinner," Frechtel said.Â  "Technically that's against company policy since I can shutdown your whole project with a click of a key.Â  But maybe we can all train together."Â  Frechtel nodded as he considered the idea that he thought was a good compromise.

"Yes," Will said.Â  "Maybe we can."Â  His words were clipped and his voice neutral.Â  Like a wild animal you never made sudden or excited movements in front of Frechtel.Â  "Let me check our schedules."

"Don't schedule anything on weekends," Frechtel said with a wink.Â  He pulled up a chair in front of "Don't worry, big guy, I'll keep that infamous Frechtel charm turned off."

"I can't tell you how happy that makes me," Will said with only a minor hint of sarcasm.Â  He tried not to notice that Frechtel's toupee had shifted slightly.Â  What DID this guy have on management?

"Great.Â  We can probably do dinners, too, but just tell..uh..." Frechtel looked over Will's desk.Â  "Where's your wife's picture?"

"We burned them," Beaks said.

Frechtel either ignored Beaks.Â  "Hmmm...oh yeah, Jess.Â  Jessie.Â  The Jess-ter." Frechtel enuciated the nickname.Â  "Tell the Jess-ter to keep it simple and spontaneous.Â  That way I don't have to file a detailed Fraternization Disclosure form, just the short Summary version."

Frechtel grabbed his mug and headed for the hallway then stopped.Â  "How fast do you guys run?" he asked turning around.

Will perked up slightly.Â  He spent a lot of time thinking about various reactions and counter-reactions for his job. His brain raced now to determine which answer would create the reaction of Frechtel, jettisoning the idea of the race, moving on to his next victim and giving Will back his morning.

"6:00 minute mile," Will said with a mostly straight face.Â  He though that was fast enough that Frechtel would know he could not keep up, but not so fast he would think it was cool to run with Will and Jess for bragging rights.

Fretchel nodded.Â  "Me, too.Â  Well, normally.Â  But I hurt my leg a while back.Â  Slowed me down to a 13:00 minute mile.Â  Which is still respectable.Â  You guys can just keep circling back for me every quarter mile or so."

Frechtel looked out into the hallway again then gave an air fist bump, somehow managing to spill some of the coffee from the no-spill mug in his other hand.Â  "Did it this weekend, boss man," he said into the hallway.Â  "I'll drop by after I finish ripping these losers a new one over their cost overruns."Â  The person in the hallway said something Will could not make out.

<em>Great</em>, Will thought.Â  If any of the other teams were unaware he was going to start asking for additional resources they knew now.Â  He could almost hear the whole floor being assigned "additional critical tasks" to lock them down into their current projects.

"Yeah," Frechtel said to the hallway.Â  "So just let me know when you're free and I'll drop by."

Frechtel had noticed the pool of coffee he had stepped in and was rubbing the bottom of his shoe against the side of the wall. "You guys live like pigs in here," he muttered.Â  Frechtel shook his no-spill mug at them presumably to demonstrate how neat-and-tidy people operated. This time the mug did not spill any coffee.Â  Frechtel walked back over to Will's desk, pulled up a chair and sat down.

"Since I have a few minutes to burn.Â  You know what I don't get about your Greek mud races?" he said, propping his feet up on Will's desk.

Will rubbed a hand over his face, leaned back and settled in for a long, long break. "What's that, Frechtel?"

There had to be a special place in Hell reserved for whoever had made Frechtel the owner and approver of every team's OPEX and personnel budget.

&nbsp;

Will opened his front door.Â  "Oh good, you're home," Will's wife Jess said.Â  She was blocking the doorway and she was in running clothes.Â  Like he should have been.

"I should have called," he said.Â  She crossed her arms and cocked a hip.

"And..." Will said tentatively, "you are the most beautiful woman in the world."Â  Jess raised an eyebrow.Â  Will wracked his tired brain.Â  "And I am lucky--"Â Â She pursed her lips considering waiting then gestured for more.

"Very, very.Â  So very, very lucky to be married to such a--"Â  Jess scowled and Will felt himself losing ground.Â  He tosses a Hail Mary.Â  "You're hair looks great".Â  He got both raised eyebrows and the scowl deepened as she took off her hat so he could get a good look at her hair pulled back into messy ponytail.Â  Will cursed to silently: rookie mistake.Â  Second one today.Â  "And your..." Will looked down at her running shoes.Â  No help there.

He sighed.Â  "I got nothing.Â  Will you accept 'I'm sorry'?"

Jess gave him a grin.Â  The same one that took his breath away the first time he saw it fifteen years ago and still did.Â  "You should have called," she agreed, kissed him lightly.Â  "It's a good thing you're smart AND pretty, Will Tanner."

She slipped past him.Â  "The kids have eaten but they are in the middle of a major blowout."

"The dog again?" Will asked.Â  Jess nodded and started off down the driveway in a light jog.

"Check the fridge"Â  she called over her shoulder.Â  "I may not have shoved ALL of your dinner in the disposal."

Will smiled as she disappeared down the street.Â Â Then he heard his daughter yell from inside.Â  "Daaaaaaddy!Â  Aaron's being mean!"

"No, I'm not!" yelled his son from some in the house.

Will's shoulders slumped as he trudged inside. "We are not getting a dog," he said to no one in particular. The night went downhill from there.

<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">-3-</p>
&nbsp;

Will cradled his phone to his ear, mentally reprioritizing tasks his personal To Do list.Â  Will was a list checker.Â  There was something deeply gratifying about knowing he had accomplished at least one thing in a day.Â  The hold music coming through the phone's speaker was starting to annoy him.

He squeezed the bridge his nose with his fingers, trying to stave off the oncoming headache. Every item on his list was "the most important thing to do".Â  The night--the entire day, really--had been a write off: Frechtel eating up the morning with banal conversation about...Will couldn't even remember.Â  Then a series of unscheduled, emergency project meetings popping up as everyone covered their 6.Â  Tonight, checking the kids' homework, eating dinner at the table rather than in his office to show penance.Â  He had finally been able to retreat here for a few moments of--

"Dad!" That was Will's son voice. Which was followed up a split second later by his daughter's.

"Daddy!"

"Stop! I'm talking to Dad, not you."

His daughter's voice went into a sing-song.Â  "Daddy-daddy-daddy!"Â  It was more of a challenge to his son than a call to him.

One or both of them was knocking, pounding really, on the door.Â  It was a race to see who he opened the door for, who had called his name last.Â  Will leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.

"Sir?" came a voice from Will's phone.

He sat up.Â  "Yes?Â  I'm here.Â  I'm here."Â  He could not hear over the kid's calling his name and pounding on the door.Â  Whatever they wanted had gotten lost in the competition to get him out of his bolt hole.Â  "Hold on," he said to the door.Â  The pounding and calling for him stopped.

"Excuse me?" the woman on the phone said.

"Not you," Will said to her.Â  "My kids.Â  They are trying to break down my door."

She was silent a moment then her voice softened slightly from the bored, official tone she had used up until now with him.Â  "Wait 'til their teenagers and they need money."Â  Her voice took on again some--but not all--of its official tone.Â  "I'm sorry, sir.Â  The supervisor was unable to step away.Â  It has been an 'active' night around here."

The pounding on the door started again and Will sighed.Â  "Have a free bed for one more?" he said tiredly.

The woman laughed.Â  "You are your father's son, aren't you, Mr. Tanner?" all of the 'official' tone was gone now.

"Dad been working his magic again?" Will asked.Â  The question both cheered him up and cut him to the quick.

"They don't make them like him any more.Â  Thank God!" the woman said and he could hear her smiling.Â  His dad did that to people.Â  Made them smile.Â  Pushed away the bad clouds for a while.Â  "He knows every one of our names, something about us, where we're from," the woman was saying.

"That's Mr. Tanner's boy?" Will heard someone say.Â  "Tell him to come on down."

"I wouldn't mind seeing what's a Tanner 2.0 look like," another woman said in the background and there was laughter.

"See what I mean," the woman on the phone said with mock severity.Â  "Every single person on this floor knows your dad and thinks theyyyyy are his favorite."

"So he's getting..." Will trailed off, knowing the answer.Â  He hated that 'hopeful little boy' tone in his voice.Â  He tapped his fingers on his desk in frustration.Â  Three quick beats.

"When he's with us," the woman said carefully.Â  She emphasized the word 'with'.Â  "But yes when he's fully with us I'm glad I can't get a lick of work out of anybody.Â  Everybody has an excuse to be in his room talking to him.Â  That man is a weapon of mass distraction."

Will laughed in spite of the tightness that was now squeezing his chest.Â  "How much is he 'there'?" he asked.

The woman consider her words for a second.Â  "His physician would be the best one to speak with you on that, Mr. Tanner," she said in her official tone again, but still gently and maybe a little sadly.

Dad had gotten to her, too, and she sounded tough as nails.Â  Will understood.Â  As a teenager they had fought, he and his dad.Â  It was not until Will was in his 20s that he understood why.Â  Tom Tanner just made you want to be a better version of yourself.Â  No, that was not it.Â  Tom Tanner made you believe you could be and maybe already were a better version of yourself.Â  He made you feel like you personally mattered.Â  Because that was Tom Tanner's gift: when you looked in his eyes you saw yourself reflected back as HE saw you--and Tom Tanner always saw the best of people.

He did not see a failure of a man on the verge of losing his wife, his job, his kids--nope, his father saw a man on his knees that would make everyone he loved proud as they watched him fight his way back to standing, showing them what real strength was.Â  He did not see broken people, he saw people who did not have to pretend to be whole anymore and could now start the process of healing stronger than they were before.Â  Even the most foul mouthed, no-manners, sullen teenager Will could find to bring over left the Tanner residence with a new mission in life, with purpose.

It was maddening.Â  The absolute last thing a teenage boy wanted ("Yes, I'm Tom Tanner's son.Â  I'll tell him.Â  I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that...") was to be a better version of himself.Â  So Will and his dad fought.Â  Will felt guilty for what he considered to be falling short of the mark which made him even angrier.Â  And so they fought more.Â  There were a lifetime's worth of words he wished he could take back now.

Sure that was all water under the bridge nowadays, Tom Tanner had said as much.Â  "Boy growing into a man throws a lot of elbows while he's trying to get that new skin on."Â  Still it didn't mean the 'elbows' didn't hurt.

<em>I am a coward, </em>Will chided himself.Â  Tomorrow, he would go on the way home from work, like he had been doing in the beginning.Â  Maybe he would leave the office early.

"Mr. Tanner," the woman said.Â  "I can make sure my supervisor calls you back tonight.Â  But it might be really late."

"Thank you.Â  Any time is fine," Will said.

<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">-4-</p>
When he opened his office door Will found his two children waiting patiently.Â  When they had stopped the pounding he figured they had gotten bored and moved on or found something else to squabble about.Â  This level of dedication to their cause was bad news.

"We waited for you," his son said.

"So I see," Will said.Â  Definitely an ambush.

"For a hundred million hours," his daughter, Eve, said crossly.Â  She had recently picked up 'a hundred million' from somewhere so everything was 'hundred million'.Â  For a second, Will thought she was going to stamp her foot for emphasis and he struggled not to smile.

Aaron was leaning against the wall. His hands were tucked behind his back.Â  He stepped forward and Will could see he was holding some papers.Â  He was in that stage where he wanted his dad to see he was becoming grown up, but happy to be a kid talking about farts, and school, and other boy stuff when he thought Will was not paying attention.Â  Will did pay attention and it did his heart good to hear the raucous, unaffected laughter of his son and his friends.Â  Nobody was throwing elbows yet.

"Well, it was a very long time," his daughter said.

"Shouldn't you be in bed, little Miss?" Will said, but his daughter only crossed her arms they way her mother did sometimes and frowned. Will was in serious danger now of picking her up and hugging her and ruining her attempt at an "adult" bad mood. He shoved his phone in his pocket and strode out the door, leaving them rushing to keep up with his long-legged strides.

Will grabbed a beer from the fridge and mentally reviewed his To-Do list, shifting some items, deciding where they intersected with--

"Will, did you hear what Aaron said?" Jess asked him.Â  His wife was sitting at the kitchen table, papers spread out beside her laptop.

Will looked up. "Huh?"

Aaron squared his shoulders and stepped forward. "A dog is good for building character in kids."

Will popped the top on his beer and leaned back against the wall. Definitely an ambush. They had turned Jess too apparently.Â  Everyone wanted Will to have this stupid dog: his kids, his wife, his mother, Jess's mother, neighbors, even Beaks, though Beaks was probably just trying to needle him.Â  Everyone except Will had an opinion--the same opinion.Â  But there was one guy--numero uno--who was going to end up taking care of that dog and there was no space left on Will Tanner's To-Do list--on any of Will Tanner's To-Do lists.

"We've talked about this dog. The answer is still no," Will said simply.Â  Case closed.

"Yes, but I have been doing some research," Aaron said. He held the papers he was holding out to Will. "The APA did a study in--"

"The APA?" Will cocked his head. "The American Psychological Association?"

"Yes, them. They did a study on pet ownership--"

"You sure it wasn't the American Pet Association, bud?" Will said, smiling.

"No," Aaron faltered. "They--they--so they did a study on kids owning dogs.Â  Dogs helps kids build responsibility, they provide companionship, they--"

Will knelt down in front of his son and looked him in the eye. "Aaron, I am proud of you for doing this research. And for coming up with an argument to support your position. But my answer still is no--"

"But you didn't even listen!" Aaron yelled. As close as they were it hurt Will's ears. He stood up asÂ Aaron tossed the paper on the ground. "You never listen to anybody!"

"Will-" his wife started.

"No dog!" Will was frustrated now. "Clear?" He looked at each member of his family until he was sure he had their full attention. "We have talked as a family. You two have expressed your opinions. Your mom and I have talked. The answer is No. Got it? Not with a debate. Not with more research. Not with tears, Eve. No."

For a moment, no one spoke. Then Eve stamped her little foot.

"You're bossy!" she yelled with tears brimming in her eyes. "And big girls don't cry!"Â  She ran from the room.

"May I go?" Aaron asked softly, carefully enunciating each word. Will nodded and Aaron walked out, his jaw set in anger.

After a moment, Jess wife, let out a breath. "Well."

Will pointed at his temple.Â  "No more space in this thing, babe. No more space. Are you going to--"

Jess held up a warning finger. "Don't. You do not do it by yourself, Will Tanner."

They stared at each other until Will looked away. After a minute, Jess stood and went to him, she snaked her arms through his and wrapped them around him.

"Smart guy aren't usually this tall," she said.

"I left my wallet at home, can you cover dinner?" Will said automatically.

"I think that's my ex-boyfriend," Jess said, her words muffled by his chest.

"I think I'm going to have another beer. You want one?" Will responded.

"What do you know about bull riding?" Jess said, looking up at him.

The spoke at the same time.Â  "Don't let go next time."

They both smiled and hugged tighter.Â  He felt even-keeled, safe and strong.Â  She felt a tornado that made a beautiful mess of his carefully laid plans for a boring life.Â Â They were an anomaly in the data. No two people should have elected to have a second date after the epic failure of their first one. Even Frechtel would have been hard pressed to find something else to screw up that night. Will had been as surprised as Jess later admitted to being when she had kissed him and whispered her number in his ear.Â  He had memorized it since he had to hold her as the two of them supported each other while they limped up to her doorstep.

"Did you get to talk to Tom?" she asked.

"No," Will said. "He was having a bad night. Probably wouldn't know my voice, know me. So, no point.Â  Supervisor is supposed to call me back though to give me some updates on his condition."

Jess nodded, stepped back and sat down in front of her computer.Â  "That makes sense."Â  A year ago she would have pushed him to go see his dad, even this late the staff would let him in--everybody loved Tom Tanner.Â  But Tom Tanner was not 'there' much any more and she knew it hurt Will deeper than he let on to see it.

"What was the argument about?" Will said. "Between the kids. When I got home."

"Aaron wanted to name the dog (which I know we aren't getting) 'Algy' or something," Jess said.

Will laughed. "It that short for Alligator? Or it is really actually 'algae'?"

Jess shrugged.Â  "Some character on a new kid's show he's watching probably.Â  All the character on those things are weird these days."

Will scanned through the printout his son had given him. "I should have let him speak his piece.Â  That was one thing Dad was great at.Â  Letting people speak their piece." He stretched and took a swig of his beer and tossed it in the sink. "I'll put them to bed." He said as he kissed his wife on the top of her head.

Will tossed his beer into the recycling bin and did a quick scan of the kitchen. The dishes could soak for an hour. "What was little Miss's name for the dog? I heard her yelling something when I came home."

"Kermit the Frog," Jess said.

"Kermit the Frog the Dog?" Will asked.Â  "Well, it's definitely a name."

His hand hovered between the Politely-Hold-Open and Close-the-Freakin-Door-Now-It's-Frechtel! buttons. That was how he thought of them at this moment. It turned out not to matter, Frechtel sprinted to the door and managed to shove his arm between the closing doors. For a brief second Will considered pushing the Door Close button just to see if it would slam closed on the small man's arm. A vision of the elevator rising with Frechtel pinned between the doors came to Will's mind. Would it slam into the floor's ceiling repeatedly or just--</p>

Frechtel said, panting. "They really need to fix that Hold-Open button. It never works."</p>
Frechtel was dressed in a pair of tight running shorts over what appeared to be a tight yellow bodysuit. He had on a visor like blackjack dealers in Vegas used to wear and aÂ waaaay-too-tight tank top. It originally had read "Beach Mode" but Frechtel had taken a marker and tried to change it to say "Beast Mode."

He gripped the elevator handrail with one hand but he couldn't stop it or his free hand from tightening into fists.</p>

"He is alive." Obnoxious, little, son-of-aâ¦. Will prayed for patience and took a deep breath. A very, very deep breath.</p>

He drew hard on every bit of resolve he had. Everything. Literally. Will was a big man and big men who are not bullies learn early on how to dampen their strength. Will even affected a slight slouch to lower his 6'4" height to look less threathening. He found himself standing up to his full height. Please, God, please. I am going to literally kill him.</p>

"It's disabled while they fix the Emergency--" The elevator slammed to an abrupt halt. Frechtel stared at the button and then at his finger. "That's weird. It's supposed to be disabled."</p>

Well, at least, Frechtel had saved him coming back after seeing his Dad to grab his cell phone. Maybe he would get home at a reasonable hour tonight.</p>

"Yeah, yeah, right," the little man said, though his face showed he was only half-convinced. His look was almost sly. "Guess you're gonna be late! Haha!" Frechtel grinned broadly. Will scowled.</p>

Somehow Will had turned around, gripped the thing with both hands and yanked with all of his strength. The red film had reduced his vision to near pinpoints. He did not pray. He did not want to.

Frechtel did not seem to notice that it was not a light shove. "It's just a small box that we might fall to our deaths in." Frechtel laughed. He laughed high pitched like a jackal. Like the Devil.</p>

His famous self control and resolve was gone. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew this screaming rage was all the only outlet keeping him from wrapping his hands around the annoying, evil little man's throat. Will went on what had to be two minutes until he finally stopped. His lower lip hurt and he thought he might have bitten it at some point in his rant. He was breathing hard but had somehow had unconsciously shoved himself against the far wall, almost into one of the corners. As far from Frechtel as possible.</p>

Frechtel moved like lightning, diving under Will's outstretched arms. Will could not halt his forward progress and slammed into the wall. He spun around, all thought gone, only deep seated rage coursing through every vein, muscle and bone in his body. He charged the little man again but at the last second the man dodged again. As Will turned to grab Frechtel something sprayed in his eyes.</p>

"Areâ¦youâ¦doneâ¦yet?" The voice was so un-Frechtel it caught Will offguard. It was not nasally or sing-songy or even remotely annoying. It soundedâ¦normal.</p>

He leaned forward and put his hands on his knees. Was he out of breath because of the epi-pen or the mad scramble a few seconds ago? He leaned back against the wall and slid down into a sitting position. Better to be on the floor before the epinephrine hit. He needed to get to a hospital. The thought reminded him of why he was in the elevator in the first place but instead of anger something else came. A different feeling. Reliefâ¦?</p>

The alarm stopped in the elevator but Will could still hear it going off in the rest of the building. The door muffled it heavily. No wonder no one had heard him yelling for help.</p>

It was an inhaler. He smiled at Will. Frechtel looked at the inhaler. "Water, I think is what they put in it. Maybe some lemon for taste. That's probably what was stinging."</p>

Exhausted. Frechtel tossed him the inhaler and then the epi-pen. Will caught them both and examined them. "You science nerds want proof of everything," Frechtel said with just a hint of his normal annoyingness. Will examined the epi-pen, it was in fact a trainer. The inhaler did in fact say it was just water and lemon flavoring. Something else that looked like a preservative. Will memorized it to look it up later.</p>

Frechtel rubbed his face like he was trying to rub it off. Will considered maybe the 'mask' Frechtel wore everyday had more purposes than even he might be aware of.</p>

"Good," Will said. "Then I can tell you freely I feel like I am failing at everything, Frechtel. As a parent, a husband, here," Will waved a hand to encompass the building around them. "I feel like I am doing a crappy job leading my team. You guys are probably going to fire me, maybe Beaks, too." Will looked at Frechtel for some sign of verification or disagreement but the little man's expression did not change. Complete poker face. What did I expect from a guy who spends most of his time convincing us all he's a jerk.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Chapter 1-
I know this man, an amalgam of irritating and long winded persons who inexplicably gain social leverage as if it is given out by trickster gods. This gives me a warm and familiar feeling, something about the sloshing coffee, breafast biscuit and and shared glances makes this first chapter feel homey and brings back vibes of 90's movies with their tropes on geeks and nerds. I get the sense that this story emerged out of discontent with work life platitudes. Personally I think so often people cross over from amiable conversation into void filling series of space occupying connection totems, things that represent connection but aren't themselves. Ok, a lot of feelings about this story space, maybe it says more about what I am bringing into this story.
I totally feel like you are in your wheelhouse, relationship comedies with snappy dialogue and understanding glances and looks are always great. I think to this is something that is growing organically, it is a story that starts with feelings of workplace frustration. How relatable. I am looking forward to seeing where this goes, I am sensing a solid presentation of conflict, a few well placed non expositionary hints "behind schedule" and "Frechtel being the sole approver". Frechtel seems to be so many frustrating social and personal conflicts embodied. He is invasive, socially deaf, messy, snarky and worst of all earnest. Imagine being so stupidly confident that you wink at someone who would cross the street to avoid you in a conspiratorial manner. All sane people live with a fear of being an outcast and rejected. But this lunatic just plunges forward smiling and making jokes never checking the pulse to see if this relationship is even alive.
I think I have things to unpack in this story, but I think it's because it is so familiar in many good ways. One I can see this person with only the hints of being small and carrying a big mug, I could pick this guy out of a line up. Two knowing glances bring me into this circle of understanding, I am in the loop. Three, this guys imposition is described so well and evokes so many disparate but sensorial similar encounters I have frankensteined a person I know well. I think this type of writing is therapy of a type, beaks is a off camera confidant we can be assured see's things as we do. He is here to validate what we feel and prove everyone else is crazy we are the sane ones.]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Graham leaned forward and put his head in his hands.  It had been such a long road.  But this was the last stop.  Almost the last stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The door opened and a tech stepped inside.  His face was appropriately somber.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâll dispose of...him,â Graham could not bring himself to say âthe bodyâ.  Not yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tech nodded and held out a small circular case.  Graham looked up at it but did not reach for it.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI said I didnât want anything like that.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tech looked down at the container.  âUh, itâs part of the package.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graham frowned.  âI told your receptionist girl I didnât want anything like that.  No memorabilia.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tech looked back and forth between Graham and the case.  âUm...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graham and the tech stared at each other.  The tech knelt down and placed the case on the floor between them.  </p>

<p><em>There is something absolutely banal about salt shakers.  Sometimes they come in plastic, or glass, but ultimately they are the pawns of the dives, diners, and grease-is-a-food-group restaurants of the world...</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Resha stared daggers at the two demigods that she could just see through the cracked storage room door.  Humans would not have been able to see that small but she could.  And the two bastards out there slurping bad coffee could surely see herâif they bothered to lookâwhich they hadnât done in about 100 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Resha was practically forgotten by her followers and now even by her jailers.  A forgotten god did not exist in the human planes.  But the diner was a nexus point, a way-station between territories.  </p>

<p>There were two things you could be sure of with Jack VINCENTâs presidency. First he was a science buff so there was always something playing in the background in the oval office. Current current feed from NASA conference proceedings and lectures, even talksBy different scientific communities and debates. It wasnât just American scientists Weâre academics either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be disconcerting the constant drone in the background. Some people said thatâs why he did it. But in truth he was a technocrat and a science geek. He spoke 14 languages and could read another 15 on top of that.The president loved learning he loves science he love math and oddly enough he loved dance</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed out of character but as he often said we canât be defined by levels lest we become nothing more than them.</p>

<p>âSo then I look down and it turns out...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew was the most interesting man in the world.  He had been for as long as people in town could remember.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI look down...â Matthew said.  He scanned the audiences faces, as usual they were in the palm of his hand.  âI was actually holding a tube of Crest toothpaste.â  Matthew mimed holding the toothpaste.  âIn my hand.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep belly-ripping laughter filled the restaurant.  Even people who had been pretending to mind their own business guffawed a little.  More than one patron pounded the table.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew smiled and sipped at his coffee.  It tasted terrible but he did not spit it back into the cup.  Maybe it would kill the fried eggs that were currently doing a polka in his stomach.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He signaled for another cup of coffee.  The waitressâs kid weaved through tables, managing not to burn anyone with the metal coffee pot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat did you think of the story, Donny?â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDanny,â the kid corrected.  âIt was good.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew looked closer at the kid.  âSomething on your mind...Danny?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid shuffled uncomfortably.  Matthew nodded.  He was sure he done this for this kid before but what the hey.  Matthew snatched a pen out of the kidâs apron.  He pulled a napkin from underneath his coffee cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started to write, dictating as he did.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDear...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>âSo then I look down and it turns out...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew was the most interesting man in the world.  He had been for as long as people in town could remember.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI look down...â Matthew said.  He scanned the audiences faces, as usual they were in the palm of his hand.  âI was actually holding a tube of Crest toothpaste.â  Matthew mimed holding the toothpaste.  âIn my hand.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep belly-ripping laughter filled the restaurant.  Even people who had been pretending to mind their own business guffawed a little.  More than one patron pounded the table.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew smiled and sipped at his coffee.  It tasted terrible but he did not spit it back into the cup.  Maybe it would kill the fried eggs that were currently doing a polka in his stomach.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He signaled for another cup of coffee.  The waitressâs kid weaved through tables, managing not to burn anyone with the metal coffee pot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat did you think of the story, Donny?â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDanny,â the kid corrected.  âIt was good.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew looked closer at the kid.  âSomething on your mind...Danny?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid shuffled uncomfortably.  Matthew nodded.  He was sure he done this for this kid before but what the hey.  Matthew snatched a pen out of the kidâs apron.  He pulled a napkin from underneath his coffee cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started to write, dictating as he did.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDear...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDaniel?â The kid offered hesitantly.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âRight,â Matthew said, turning back the napkin.  âDear,â Matthew pointed the pen at the kid and winked, âDaniel.â He started writing again.  âYouâre a great kid.  All the best, your friend, Matthew Mark Luke.â Matthew finished the signature with a flourish (he had practiced that thousands of times at home).  He handed the pen and the napkin to the kid.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[E. was sitting at the kitchen table doing his homework.Â  He father was sitting across from him reading the evening paper's sport section, eating a sandwich. E.'s mother was packing his and his father's lunches for the week.

he and his family had celebrated his birthday that night.Â  18 G.D. years old.Â  At dinner, E. had told his parents about the lists of curse words he had put together over the years and how he had planned to wake them up to him reading through all of them.Â  His parents had gotten a good laugh out of that and asked him to at least wait until after breakfast tomorrow.

"Did you mow the Netane's lawn, Quentin?"

"What?" Quentin said, looking up.

E.'s mother paused from slicing the sandwiches she was working on.Â  "I ran into Lana at the store and she asked me to thank you but to tell you not to worry about doing it in the future since she was going to purchase her own lawn mower."Â  E. looked over at his mother.Â  She was doing that thing where she was smiling but really not smiling.

Quentin Longstreet sunk a little in his chair.Â  "Oh, yeah.Â  Oh, yeah.Â  I was out getting the garbage cans in and noticed how bad her lawn was looking."Â  E.'s mother said nothing, but her smile somehow got bigger.Â  "Just trying to keep the neighborhood's property value's up," his father finished weakly.

E.'s mother looked over at him.Â  "Since you do our lawn, E., you won't mind picking up Lana's as well, will you, dear?"

E. looked at his father then mother.Â  "Will that increase my allow--?"Â  E.'s mother's smile dropped.Â  "Or I could just do it to, to keep the property values up."Â  E.'s mother's smile returned.

"Wonderful.Â  And Lana can probably figure out how to get her own garbage cans in from the curb, Quen.Â  Don't you think?"

&nbsp;

<hr />

&nbsp;

E. looked at his notebooks of curse words and...other stuff.Â  He could not believe that his life long obsession had been to curse his parents out on his 18th birthday.Â  It seemed beyond juvenile; it seemed...sad.Â  E. looked around.

"Damn titty penis poop," he said softly, then looked around again.Â  "Damn--"

"E., are you out there?" his mother called from inside.Â  E. jumped.Â  Had she heard him?!?Â  <em>Oh, gosh, oh gosh!</em>

"What, yeah, coming," he said as he lifted the lid of the can, started to toss the journals in then realized they were Ms. Upskirt's garbage cans.

"Holy fried bananas, dad!" he muttered, realizing how close to a SNAGU (System Normal All Gummed Up) he had come.Â  If those had gone in Ms. Knocker's ta-tas...and what if she had found them while she was rooting around in there with a miniskirt on, something tasteful but that had been shrunk in the wash without her realizing it?Â  E. did not even want to think what would have happened if he hadn't noticed he had his hands on Ms. Supple's cans.Â  He opened his family's garbage cans and thrust the journals in.Â  Then he dashed inside.

&nbsp;

<hr />

&nbsp;

The morning of his 18th birthday did not bring the long sought after cursing monologue the younger E.'s had dreamed of.Â  E. slept in.Â  It was noon before his mother poked her head into his room and asked if he planned to sleep the next 18 years away.

"No, mom," E. said, rolling out of bed.

"Good," she said.Â  "I left your fucking breakfast on the table so you may need to warm it up."Â  Then she left.

E. stared after her, his mouth wide open.Â  Slowly he stood up and shook his head to clear it.Â  He pinched his arm slightly, waiting.Â  When he did not sprout antlers and no cartoon characters walked into the room he decided he was not dreaming and he had just misheard his mother.Â  Still....

"Mom, you feeling okay?" he called after her.

"Yes," she called back up the stairs.

E. pulled on a most likely clean shirt and definitely clean pair of shorts.Â  He went downstairs to the kitchen and grabbed himself some orange juice from the fridge.Â  His mom was at the sink, finishing up the breakfast dishes.

"Mom, did you, upstairs did you, say...um."Â  E. sat down.

"Yes, I told you that you would need to heat up your own breakfast.Â  I am doing the dishes now and you slept all morning and I do not have time," his mother said.

E. held up his hand.Â  "Okay, okay.Â  I wasn't asking about that.Â  I was--forget it."

E.'s father came in from the garage.Â  He was dressed in his factory uniform.Â  "How's that mostly firm ass hanging?" Quentin asked, as he swatted his wife on the bottom.Â  E.'s mother gave her husband a kiss on the cheek.

"Dad," E. said, shocked. "What are you doing?!?"

Quentin Longstreet looked over at his son.Â  "Sorry, E.Â  Management all have their thumb up each other's asses down at the water plant.Â  All Hands on Dick emergency this morning."

E. stared in horror at his father.

His father held up his hands.Â  "E., I am sorry.Â  I know it's your birthday.Â  I will make it up to you.Â  We'll go out and score some blow and hookers when I get back."

E. shot to his feet.Â  "Drugs?Â  Prostitutes?Â  What the--what the--what the heck, Dad!?:

E.'s mother spun around.Â  E.'s father looked like E. had slapped him.Â  They both looked at each other.Â  "E.," his father said slowly.Â  "I know you are upset.Â  I know you are 18 and feeling your oats a little this morning.Â  But you are still under my roof and profanity is not any more acceptable today than it was yesterday."

E.'s jaw dropped.Â  "Dad, you just popped mom on her bottom, asked about it, then told me we would get hookers and drugs tonight when you got home."

E.'s mother and father looked at each other.Â  "And..." his father said.

E. stared at the two, waiting.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bass rattled the windows and pens danced on the nearby dorm desk to the tune of this inaudible field of sound. Michael twisted the knob and the lights started to flicker and the strong smell of cinnamon filled the air. Before him the shape of a christmas tree and the sound of a smoke alarm beeping. Michael exhaled sharply, twisted the knob to turn off the device and blinked his eyes sitting up. I got it, he said looking amazed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I suppose you may want to hear about the machine before you that made this commotion, but honestly the technical description is kind of boring. Itâs a bunch of floor speakers and a custom ultra precise mixing board. I think you would like a analogy better, one that will take you past the physical components and closer to the purpose of this device. You know that feeling when someone jumps from behind something and you freeze. In that moment something deep inside reacts before you can and your hair stands on end and you can hear your heartbeat rushing in your ears. Well that sound of your heartbeat is always present like a metronome in your head. You donât hear it consciously because that would drive you crazy. But some part of you always listens to your heart thumping. When your heartbeat goes up your sense of time slows, when it falls the seconds stretch. The machine is like a radio for consciousness using your heartbeat. So this device is like matching consciousness to sound, well maybe more accurately a vibration, something like that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the right landing point is hard, you need the right pitch, tempo and tune. Most of all you need a strong sensory memory that you can dial in like a radio station coming in clear amongst the fuzz of forgotten days. Michael chose the christmas eve when his mother burnt the hell out of cinnamon snickerdoodles. He remembered it well because smoke billowed out of the oven and the whole house smelt like the armpit of the pillsbury doughboy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was six that christmas eve, and he knew she lived only two miles away and would probably be going to church that night. I will go straight up to her, she will probably be with her parents, and ask her to be my friend, thatâs what a kid would do Michael thought. He lay down in the middle of the speakers and closed his eyes and out stretched his hand to flip the switch. The low rumble began and he turned the device to 48 A/H. He focused on his breathing trying to relax and smell the cinnamon, he began to smell the smoke, and then he could taste it. He sat up coughing and rubbed his eyes. He wacked himself in the face and looked down to see small clumsy hands. He laughed and looked down to see Maui, the long dead family dog nudging his leg looking expectant. Hi Maui he said grinning.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">You did what? Michael's sister, Marie, said. He turned and quickly studied her young face. It had been a long time since they had talked face to face. Nothing he said, in a high voice he had forgotten. Wow, everything looks so different through young eyes he thought, kind of bigger and brighter. Michael walked into the kitchen hoping to see his mother, but she was currently shrouded in a cloud of smoke from the cookies. Michael sat on a small chair that used to be for time out and waited for the air to clear. His mother rushed from the counter and opened all the windows in the kitchen. With wide eyes Michael started to see his young mother as the smoke dissipated, youthful but currently distressed. She was wearing an apron overA a red long sleeve shirt and was using a metal pan to fan smoke out the window. She turned to see him sitting and staring at her among the smog and said a frantically âhoney, will you get your dad?â</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> He hopped up and started towards the door to the porch to see his father. He was skipping towards the door when around the corner his Brother, Riley waddled in front of him and the two collided. Riley fell back and looked up at Michael. This was the brother who was a high school champ in wrestling and cross country star, but now he was small and stubby. The young helpless face kept looking up expectantly and Michael could see in it his brother in his little puppy sweater and sandals. Ha! He said aloud in such surprise, if only you could see yourself you little squirt. Rileyâs eyes started to well up and he could tell he wasnât hurt just startled. Michael reached over and tried to help him up but could quite make out how strong his young body was and fell over too. He started to laugh on the floor, these moments donât come back but here one was, a brand new childhood memory unfolding. Riley and Michael clambered up using a nearby chair and Michael grabbed Riley's face and pulled it close, you are fantastic. Unsure how to feel Riley decided to continue to see if the cookies were ready, much to his disappointment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dad wasnât as fat as he is now and he was smiling talking to his Dad on the phone. Michael's Dad and Grandfather used to always talk on the phone before his Grandfather died. He looked so vibrant and beaming, they were talking about sports and family plans for the Holiday. I really hope he remembers this talk, it seems like a good one. Michael walked up to his dad and tugged on his bright green shirt. âHold on, I gotta call you back, Love you too! Tell mom we are looking forward to seeing her.â Brantley turned and pushed the antennae back into the clunky cordless phone, hey buddy he said just like Michael remembered.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to church Michael listened to songs he hadnât heard in a long time and he had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the back of the van. It was sensational, absolutely poetic, something about being a kid makes food taste very different. Michael was wearing tiny corduroys with a collared white shirt and a red and green vest. He kept looking in the mirror before church and laughing, his mother loved that. Michael even danced a little looking at his hip vest. The family found a parking spot and spilled out towards the church.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later Michael went to the deacons funeral who presently met them at the door and welcomed them in with a âMerry Christmasâ. He shook his hand and said thanks. The family walked towards the sanctuary and Michael was taking two steps for every one of his parents and it felt like running. His parents were in a hurry to celebrate the season and were hungrily making haste to get good seats to celebrate the season of giving. The corridors were decorated with green faux garland, red bows and sparkly Christmas lights. Michael was slowly figuring out how use his tiny legs when he saw Elloryâs mother talking to a old woman with a big yellow hat. Elloryâs mom was wearing a jean dress that made here look like a column of blue and had puffed up brown bangs like a thin wave crashing on a pale shore. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael pulled his hand away from his Dad and told them he had to go pee. Ok, lets go fast Michael's dad said. Crap this was something he hadnât thought through, he had forgotten the days when bathroom trips were accompanied. âNo Brantley, I can do this myself. I will come and find you in your usual seats when I am done.â Michael's dad looked stunned, not only did his son just call him by his first name for the first time he had also formed a very adult sentence. Alright, he said after a pause then turned towards the sanctuary leaving Michael by the door. Ok, game time he thought as he trotted up to Mrs. Clark. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âHello, my name is Michael Ross and I would like to play with your daughter.â What a proper young boy Mrs. Clark said a bit quizzically, she wasnât sure whoâs child this was and looked around for someone looking back. âEllory come say hello to this nice young manâ she said turning to see the chair her daughter was in. She wasnât there. Elloryâs mother spun on heel like a graceful two hundred pound ballerina. Her eyes landed on Ellory standing in the nativity scene mimicking a plastic Sheppard. Â Her mother scolded her for walking off then insisted she say hello. Ellory looked upset to see her time as a part of the nativity had ended. Ellory had a pale complexion pointed face with a cleft chin and copper hair. Her brown eyes were were large and kind. Her small figure made her green dress almost reach her red Mary Jane shoes. Michael rocked back and forth nervously as Ellory walked over. â I would like to be your friendâ he said and extended his hand for a shake. â I am sorry, I am allergic to bees, so my Mom doesnât let me play with strangers. And all my friends ride horses, have you ever ridden a horse?â She said very matter of fact ignoring his outstretched hand. âI love horses but I have never ridden oneâ Michael said eager to relate. âNo, all my friends ride horses. I like horses and all my friends ride them. I think we cant be friends.â She turned and trotted off straight after her plain spoken rejection. I think I need a new plan Michael thought. Michael closed his eyes tightly and started tapping behind his ears. He opened his eyes to see the off white ceiling of his college dorm.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bess watched as the new girl twisted the thick chain around her husband and pressed the padlock through the links, securing it. The brightly dressed girl made a show of inserting a large key into the padlock and turning it. From the audience, Bess watched her for the slightest hint of flirtation or overtones of sexuality in her posture or gesture. There was none. Nothing except the brilliant white smile as the girl waved the key around then dropped it into a silk sack.

From the seat beside Bess, Robert groaned. âI hate this one,â he said.

âThe girl?â Bess asked, though she knew the answer.

âThe trick,â Robert grumbled. âItâs always this trick with him now.â

On stage, the girl helped Bessâs husband into a large, cylindrical copper tank. It would be filled with water Bess knew. She hoped it was witheringly cold.Â  She would have made it cold.

âIt is his magnum opus,â Bess said.Â  There was no scorn or irony in her voice, but then she had practiced that for a long time.

âTwo died trying it, did you hear?"Â  Robert took out a handkerchief and took his spectacles off to clean them but he kept his eyes squinting at the stage. "Drowned. Before they could get them out."

Bess could see her husband trying to scan the audience through the footlights until he disappeared behind the lip of the top of the tank.Â  The girl closed the lid and put another lock onto it and then stepped back with her arms raised.

"They were together?" Bess asked.

Robert looked over, confused, then remembered his earlier statement.Â  He turned his eyes back to the stage.Â  "Different towns."

On stage, the girl had flipped over a large, sand-filled hour glass.Â  She paraded around it.Â  Bess admired the grace with which the girl moved.Â  She was very fetching.Â  Bess tried to ignore the part of her that hoped the girl would trip and fall into the orchestra pit or the foot lights...face first.

"Together would be something," Robert smiled, but Bess noticed that his hands were gripping the edges of his seat.Â  "One come out dead, other come out alive.Â  That would be something."

Bess counted silently.Â  The sand grains could be controlled by a secret lever to move faster or slower, though the assistant had to be able to press down on the switch with her high heels.Â  The girl was not near her husband's lavishly decorated trunk so either she did not know about the switch or did not see a need for it yet.Â  Her smile was impeccable.

After a few moments, Robert looked over at Bess.Â  "He ever tell you what he thinks about while he is in there?"

The girl began inching back towards the trunk.Â  Bess could see a slight beading of sweat on the girl's forehead as her left heel slowly tried to find the switch.

Bess said.Â  "He thinks about dying in a water-filled tank, wrapped in chains."

"Ah," Robert said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">He pulled on a gray t-shirt and walked outside. The wind was blowing the tops of the trees and the spanish moss clung to the branches as the gust swept them out and up. Moonlight peared through the lush treetops in radiant silver light. Michael wobbled a bit as he walked towards brick streets, he touched his fingers one at a time to his thumb assessing his dexterity. He could still hear the carols and commotion of the crowded church at christmas in his head. Dark blue clouds with silver crusts raced above him, and he wasnât sure where he intended to go, he just felt the need to be somewhere. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âHey, where ya going?â A voice called from behind him, Jay trotted down the stairs of the library, probably kicked out for being too loud and annoying studying students.âHey Jay, nice jacket.â âThanks man I think it compliments my hatâ He leaned his head showing off his trademark fedora. âI think it does tooâ Michael said with exceptional effort to mask any tone that should rightfully be present when complimenting a fedora. âWanna walk to the park with me?â Michael suggested knowing that Jay was gonna walk with him anyway. âSure, you know I was just thinking about you, and what happened and I wanna ask you if you are all good buddy? Â Michael said I am ok and thanked him for asking and Jay continued placing his hands on the outside collar of his black denim sport coat âI think you should write about it, or maybe you could do a play about it?â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael nodded politely, and knew Jay was about to turn the conversation towards theater and decided to oblige his friend with a question. âLet's say there was a play, and you may now of one already, that doesnât go in order. How would you have two characters meet?â Jays face lit up with the challenge and he put up a dramatic finger and turned his head up and away from Michael like a form of prayer to the gods of theater. â Ok I got it- you ready?â âGo for itâ Michael leaned back resting his arms over the park bench. Jay began and continued breathlessly for twenty minutes about fathers and a guy who is told he has to be a banker in London while Michael drifted off thinking about Ellory, his young parents and the terrible christmas song about shoes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay grinned reveling in the participation of his audience as Michael snapped back happy to see his looks of pondering made it look like he was really paying attention. Jay Â shouted in an British accent âI mussnât wait any longer for my papa to see me, for I am not businessmanâ With a swift motion Jay grabs his hat and pulls it swiftly off his head and holds it in a closed fist. âI am a thespian, a bard, and a fool and you will never withdraw from the account of my soul papaâ Â Jay jumped up and threw his hat into the air. The wind caught the hat and carried a ways. Enjoying the silence he set after, Michael thought about what to try next as he watched his friend chase his hat down to the edge of the pond. Maybe I should read her writing he thought, people can reveal more than they intend. He gave a thumbs up to Jay as he rung out his cloth cap.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âAh,â Arthur said. He pulled his chain pocket watch out and stared at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âCutting it a bit close, he is.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âIs he?â Bess stared hard at the side of the tank, counting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She listened for the tap from inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She was too far away to hear it she knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>On stage the new girl was looking down now at the tank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Bess knew she had found the switch and was trying to decide if she should step on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>If she did a door would open the water would come crashing out, draining all over the stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Bess had never used it live but had tested it often enough during practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>It could be embarrassing and Harry would probably fire the girl, but he would not be dead.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the tap came it was not soft.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>It was a loud clang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The girl started and took a step back from the tank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The clang came again and Arthur jumped to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He was about to charge the stage when the girl darted toward the tank and turned the wheel to open the hatch. It flew open immediately and Harryâs head thrust out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He took in an enormous gulp of air and then another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Bess realized she was on her feet also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She looked around; some of the audience was but more were still in their chairs, staring at the tank with rapt attention.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harryâs eyes opened and he stared out into the audience, trying to scan the faces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He looked sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Bess knew he could not see her through the footlights but she still slipped slightly behind Arthur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>After a moment, Harryâs face took on a sheepish grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Bess recognized the face since she had watched him practice it in the mirror for hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The Performer was back, his mask firmly in place.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âTerribly sorry,â Harry said. âHad a bit of a nap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Sleep is very important for the constitution, you know.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The audience laughed though there was a slight tinge of nervousness to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Harryâs new assistant reached forward to help him out of the tank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The chains were gone but he held a lock in one hand and he handed it to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>While he was turned away from her side of the audience, Bess slipped quietly down the row of seats and up the aisle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Arthur, she knew, would be making his way to back stage, most likely to berate Harry for letting the trick go on so long or maybe just to open a few bottles of champagne and hit the town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>One could never tell with Arthur where his emotions would end up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bess heard the audience clapping behind her as she passed through the auditorium doors and into the lobby.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âNot a show for the faint of heart, is it, maâam,â someone said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She looked up to see a doorman, smiling at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He opened the door and signaled one of the waiting cabs forward.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She let him help her into the cab and gave him a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She was still a beautiful woman and he perked up slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He closed the door and she leaned back into the seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The Performer was back, her mask firmly in place.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âNo,â she said, as the cab drove off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âItâs not for the faint of mind either.â</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The small brick walled room was covered with stacks of books. Small piles of papers sat punctuated by Chaucer and Dickens, hardbacks rested on a long wooden coffee table with sticky mugs and assorted highlighters. Behind the worn couch hung a massive portrait of Charles Dickens with paper and quill in hand at a writing desk looking involved in thought. âI am sorry but I cannot do that, and I donât think the news staff should have suggested you come collect the papers.â Professor Eddie Mcallister said as he licked his finger and turned the page of an essay. Michael was worried that the English professor may have contacts at the school news and inquire about Michael's lie. âWell, I will go back and tell them myself, to be honest I pushed for this, she was a friend of mine. I always liked her writing.â Michael sat back and narrowed his lips, the professor set his grading aside and took off his glasses, his brown eyes deep and kind offering some quiet understanding. The moment hung, voices of students passing by could be heard in the still air. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment was broken comfortably by Eddie reaching for his tea and sipping it, closing his eyes then opening them and then nodding softly. He smiled warmly and cleared his throat âWhen did you meet?â Michael thought about how to answer this question, he didnât want to be deceptive and he had met Ellory once when he was five. Mcalister's oval face bobbed back and forth slowly as Michael thought. âWe met when I was about five, she liked to ride horses and we became close at a young age.â Michael felt a bit dirty, it was clear to him that the Professor had taken a genuine concern in Michaels state of mind, and Michael didnât know her well enough to be terribly sad that she died. âI lost a daughter at about her age, drugs, she was a smart girl and liked to ride horses when she was young, well, pony's really. I miss her.â The two shared a soft smile, Michael again felt guilty, he did care for Ellory but she was a stranger to him and not his friend, she had made that clear fifteen years ago. I just want her essays he thought, he went through the motions of asking again in his head but decided to ask a different question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âProfessor, I have been working on a story project, it is something I think will amaze you, and if you see it and really like it I think you should give me the essays she wrote. If you arenât amazed, then, well you donât have to give me her stories.â Michael said. âWell, School policy is not flexible. But I would love to see your project.â Mcalister's voice bounced playfully. The professor expected pictures glued to pages and a collection of poems, the speakers on the floor pulled quizzical look from his face as he walked around the device. It took Michael finally saying how grateful he was to have Mcallister share his project for Ellory and how it helped him cope to convince Eddie to lay on the mat on the floor. The needles on the gauge jumped and it caused the professor to look up at Michael frightened by the speakers popping to life. A small sound followed like a low note in an auditorium echoing and building. Michael turned the knobs to find the right frequency, he decided to use the christmas settings, to find a memory of similar importance and volume. The professor closed his eyes, he began to feel itchy and opened his eyes to blackness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie popped up out of the pile of leaves and saw Sofie trotting around the pile and said âNot yet Daddy! You didnât count long enough.â Slowly he crawled through the leaf pile towards his young daughter and then scooped her into his arms. He started to cry and held her head next to his. âIts ok Daddyâ¦ Its okâ She said. He looked into her copper eyes and Eddie laughed at her look of confusion and concern. She smiled, happy to see him no longer crying. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The room started to come back, the beige ceiling slowly drifted into focus. And the professor sat up.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A vase hurled through the air and smashed against the giant tank. The new girl, who was already on her knees picking up pieces of a broken bottle, cringed and scurried back. She looked helplessly at Harry for a moment then crawled forward and tentatively put out a hand to snatch at one of the shards.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âLeave it!â Arthur yelled and picked up another vase. The girl cringed again and scrambled backwards again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By Harryâs count his best friend had smashed four holes in the wall, broken a changing screen over his knee and smashed three, no, four vases and bottles against his tank.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âDoyle, pleaseââ</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âPlease? Please?â Arthur spun around and waved the vase in Harryâs face. âWhy is this one important to you?â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry considered the vase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âYesââ</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur hurled the vase against the wall. Instead of smashing it bounced off. Arthur and Harry both stared at it.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âIs that...?â Arthur asked, his anger forgotten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Harry walked over and picked it up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âNo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Just a bad throw, I think.â<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He tossed it to Arthur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur examined it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He rolled his throwing arm a few times and flexed his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âPerhaps you are getting tired of breaking my props?â Harry ventured.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur looked up suddenly and threw the vase at Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The magician ducked and vase bounced off the wall, slid down and landed on the floor where it spun a few times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The two men stared at the vase for a moment, perplexed.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âUncanny,â Arthur said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He rocked back and forth on his feet, like a school boy; slightly excited, slightly terrified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry saw the girl out of the corner of his eye starting to edge towards the vase, hoping to save at least one from the Lionâs tantrum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He shook his head slightly at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Arthur was likely done breaking Harryâs props for the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Strange occurrences always put Arthur in a better mood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur sat down at the chair in front of Harryâs makeup mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âWhat were you thinking?!<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>That was too long even for you and you know it.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry considered a flippant remark but decided against it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Arthur Doyle was usually brash, sometimes vulgar, and always in the right but he was always Harryâs dearest friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead Harry searched his memory for the new girlâs name. Nothing came so instead he just motioned for the green room door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She gratefully opened it and fled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur watched her go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âBess was here tonight,â he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, Harry thought, Arthur is not done breaking my things after all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âWas she?â Harry stooped to pick up the unbreakable vase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âShe enjoy the show?â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur was on him before Harry had finished standing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>His right fist slammed into Harryâs stomach and then blasted into the right side of Harryâs jaw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He fell onto the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Arthur stood over him with fists clenched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He put his boot beside Harryâs hand, not on it, but very close beside it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>A clear message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>A magicianâs hands were integral for even the basest of tricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Harry kept himself completely still, not even looking up at Arthur.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a long, tense moment where Harry thought Arthur might do it; that he might stomp down on his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Instead Arthur knelt down and sat beside him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He pulled out a flask and took a pull off of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He set it down in front of Harryâs still outstretched hand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âI would say not,â Arthur said softly. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  Â </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry took the flask and sat up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He took a sip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>It was a decent scotch and it burned comfortably as it went down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>He took a long pull.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âYou brought her?<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>She wasâ¦with you?â<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Harry asked tentatively.Â Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur caught the tone in his voice and shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âYes with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>No, not with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>The two of youââ</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âI have been meaning to call on her," Harry said quickly.Â  "Why was she in New York?â</span></p>
Arthur looked at him as if he was trying to consider whether or not to slug Harry again.Â  He snatched his flask back, took a pull and capped it off.

"She lives here now," Arthur stood up and offered Harry a hand.

"You have not hit me in a while like that, Doyle," Harry said, letting his friend pull him up.

"You have not needed it in a while like that, Harry," Arthur smiled slightly.Â  "Blame it on the vase and a boxer's pride."

"I will burn the vase tonight or have...ah, the new girl do it," Harry said.

Arthur picked up the coat rack from the floor where he had knocked it earlier during his rant.Â  He pulled a hat and coat off and inspected them for damage.Â  "The girl.Â  Are you with her?"

Harry shook his head.Â  "Not...really."Â  Arthur gave him a sour look but said nothing.Â  Moral aggrandizement was not his style.

"You should call on, Bess.Â  I will have my man bring her address around to you."

Harry sat in the chair in front of his makeup mirror.Â  He gave his face a critical look, turning his head from side to side.

Arthur put on his coat and hat and gave Harry a rye smile.Â  "I pulled the goddamn punches, Harry.Â  You are no uglier now than you were 10 minutes before."

Harry felt his jaw.Â  It was tender and definitely bruised but did not feel broken.

"How about a real drink?" Arthur asked.Â  Harry shook his head.Â  "Okay, Harry.Â  I will look you up Thursday then."

"Thursday," Harry said, smiling.Â  The Performer mask was in place.Â  Arthur paused.Â  He stared at Harry.

"You saw her?" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.Â  "Tonight."

Harry shook his head.

Arthur sighed heavily though there was relief in it.Â  He tossed Harry a coat and hat.Â  "Come on," he said.Â  "My man says there is a new one in town.Â  Black candles and a board and whispered voices.Â  The whole kit and caboodle apparently."

Harry touched his jaw again then stood up.Â  He slipped into his coat.Â  "I do not think you pulled either of those punches."

Arthur shrugged.Â  "Ask the vase."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhy did you do that to me?â The professor peered past the glasses resting on the bridge of his nose. Michael wasnât sure what to say and he knew the Eddie had more on his mind so he stared back across the table stacked with Elloryâs papers and breakfast food. âIf that really was real, like you say, then I am very uncomfortable. I have come to terms with the solid nature of the past, I am comfortable with the idea that I canât change it. It took me years to get to this, so many emotional lessons and late nights and all the group therapy.â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael swallowed hard and adjusted in the booth. The professor pulled his sleeves past his elbows and pointed an ink stained index finger at Michael âYou have no idea, and no right to take the past from me. What do you want me to do? Relive all my mistakes!â Michael picked up his Styrofoam coffee as a kind of shield and took a sip. The waitress came by and asked if they needed anything else while clearing the plates of sticky syrup and half eaten biscuits. Eddie shook his head and Michael mouthed the word no while examining the cardboard sleeve on his coffee. Only two other tables were occupied in the Waffle House, a group of intoxicated students and a table of worn out truckers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the waitress walked back behind the counter Eddie looked back to Michael and waited. âI am sorry,â Michael said as he set his cup down and looked intently at the old professor, âI didnât think it would bother you, I thought you would like to see her again.â âOf course I liked it!â Eddie interjected â But what do I do with that?!â Eddie raised his eyebrows. âWell, pick one thingâ Michael started timidly, beginning the sentence without knowing how it would end. âOne thing that you wish you could change. Just one. I thought about different things when I started that I could change, like becoming the best investor ever or a psychic to mess with people.â Michael tried to add some jest to lighten the mood but Eddieâs face kept the same intent narrowed eye look. âSo pick one. I am starting with Ellory. A friendship, getting to know her.â Eddie sat back, chortled a bit, and crossed his arms. âYou havenât thought this through at all. You have the ability to go back and do something not even the most brilliant man or richest man can do. But you havenât thought about the consequence, you are like a kid who found a cosmic power tool.â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie reached over and slid the glass salt and pepper shaker in front of him. âHave you ever heard of âopportunity costâ?â Michael shook his head, no. âOk, so letâs start with opportunityâ The professor held out the pepper shaker in his left palm. âOpportunity is what you want to do, right? Right. And the cost--â The professor held out the salt shaker in his right palm to make a scale with his hands. âThis cost, is how much the achievement will cost you. So even something you might call good, like making a large amount of money, has cost. In an extreme case, it may be that you start to prioritize money over loved ones, or a more complex cost could be what you donât realize, learn or act on because of your money. People make this judgement all the time but the scale is somewhere in their heads. Fortunately people donât get to physically live out the âwhat ifâsâ, which is another can of worms you have cracked open. Both the action and, importantly, the cost of the achievement play a big part of who we are. And youâ¦â Â Eddie paused and shook his head, spitting a short laugh in disbelief âYou want to go back but you havenât thought about what it will cost you.â</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michael watched as the professor got up, threw down a bill and walked out the door. He slurped his coffee and looked over at the table of drunk kids flicking paper wrappers at each other. He exhaled shortly, gathered Elloryâs papers and started back to his dorm with lots to think about while he read.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The night was chilly and Harry tugged his coat tighter as the exited the theatreâs back door. Arthur lit a cigar and looked up into the sky. âSo many damn stars up there.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry lit a cigarette. A few feet away a large man got out of a parked car and walked around to open on of the backseat doors for them. Harry sized the man up as he and Arthur walked to the car. His nose had been broken so many times it was almost flat and a series of scars crisscrossed his left cheek. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âGood show, âister. Doyle?â The man spoke with a fast cadence so it took Harry a moment to parse his words. Arthur climbed into the car and moved over to make space for Harry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âYou did not want to see the show yourself?â Harry asked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âI pay him to drive my car and look menacing while he is doing it, Harry, not to sit on his ass watching you drown,â Arthur said from the car. âGet in already I am freezing.â Harry climbed in alongside Arthur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âFind him at the gymnasium?â Harry asked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur tamped out his half-finished cigar on his boot and tossed it out the window. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âA boxer, yes. Well, from your old world actually,â Arthur said. Harry watched as the man stooped over and picked up Arthurâs discarded cigar as he walked around to get into the driverâs seat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âA carney?â Harry asked, slightly surprised. âStrong man?â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âNo, a magician. Of course, a strong man. What else would a hulking brute like that do?â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man slid into the driverâs seat and the car leaned slightly to the left. He turned around and held the cigar out to Arthur. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âWhat?â Arthur pushed his hand away. âWhat are you doing with that?â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man shrugged and pocketed the cigar in his jacket pocket. ââEw said if âewâve tossed a cigar or cigaâette âalf smoked up to get it when no oneâs lookinâ. And give it when no oneâs around.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âI meant good cigars!â Arthur bellowed. âAnd when I was with important people!â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man started the car. ââeâs not important?â He waved a hand in Harryâs direction. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur leaned back and rubbed his temples. âNo, he is an idiot. Like you. Now, drive!â Harry chuckled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man put the car into drive and then put it back into park. The three waited.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âTo the seance,â Arthur said. The man put the car into drive then put it back into park. âThe woman,â Arthur said after a minute. The man put the car in drive and was about to put it back into park when Arthur said through gritted teeth âCrandonâ. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man nodded and drove, pulling into the light traffic. In a surprising display of humor the man rolled his eyes at Harry in the rear view mirror. The expression looked odd on such a brutish face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âDoes your man have a name?â Harry asked, his voice delighted. âI am Harry, by the by.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âDobbs,â the man said. âIâm Dobbs, Harry By the By.â<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Harry smiled widely and the man gave him a covert wink.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âIdiots,â Arthur grumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>âSo many damn idiots down here."</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The seance was across town in one of the up-and-coming neighborhoods.Â  Rather than being prestigious and staid, it was vibrant with a hint of new money on the scene.Â  Dobbs parked the car at the head of an alley and opened the door for them.Â  Harry noticed the large man was continually scanning the alley and adjoining street.

"Expecting trouble, Mr. Dobbs?"

"Just 'Dobbs', sir, please.Â  And no, no trouble."Â  Harry followed Dobbs' gaze over to a few teenagers trying to look tough, loitered on the street corner near the mouth of the alley.Â  They noticed Dobbs and after a moment of recognition, quickly cleared out.

Arthur stepped out of the car.Â  He smirked at quickly disappearing figures in the distance.Â  "Connoisseurs of the darker side of the ring, I see."Â  He turned to Dobbs.Â  "You have fans.Â  Isn't that grand."

Dobbs closed the car door.Â  "You want I should come inside, Mr. Doyle?"

"No, no, my good Dobbs.Â  We will be right as rain."

Arthur took Harry's arm and led him toward a door off the side of the alley.Â  As Arthur opened it a faint aroma of cigarettes and perhaps opium wafted out.Â  The two stepped inside and found themselves in an anteroom for a small coffee and tea shop.Â  A few late night carousers, mostly students by the looks of their clothes, huddled around tables debating or joking or reading.

Arthur left Harry and went to the man behind the counter and bent his head forward for a quiet conversation.Â  The man shook his head and Arthur began whispering at him more forcefully.Â  Harry turned to scan the room, bored.Â  Arthur would get them in or he would not.Â  There was nothing to be done with--

Harry stopped cold.Â  Sitting two tables from him was Bess.Â  She wore different clothes than she had earlier that evening.Â  Something he had not seen her in, but he thought women were wont to buy new clothes with the mood struck them.Â  Harry shook off that line of thinking and scolded himself.Â  Bess was nothing if not frugal.Â  She had stretched every penny they had to get them from town to town and state to state and through every shoddy rundown venue or carnival on the way she could get him booked in.Â  Still the dress was new.Â  I pale cream colored dress in the modern style.

Harry moved forward a few steps then stopped, marveling at how kind the light was to her right now.Â  She looked...Â  He sat down across from her, suddenly nervous.

"Be--" he tried, then stopped as he choked.Â  He started again.Â  "Bess, I did not expect to find you here."

Her head was down, hair covering her face slightly.Â  Harry waited.Â  After a moment, he tried again.Â  "I have been meaning to call on you.Â  Once I heard you were here.Â  Not here, but here in New York."

Slowly, Bess lifted her head.Â  Cold, blue eyes stared into his and Harry realized it was Bess, but also was not.Â  "Harry," she said, her voice a low, rasping whisper.Â  Suddenly, she collapsed almost in on herself and water splashed everywhere.

"Harry?"

Harry looked around.Â  Arthur was standing beside him.Â  "Are you all right?"

Harry looked around and felt his clothes.Â  Everything was dry.Â  "I...yes," he said.Â  "Is it time?"

Arthur nodded, concern in his face.Â  "Are you all right?" he asked again, more slowly.

Harry stood.Â  The table, of course, was empty as he had known it would be.Â  "Right as rain.Â  Let's go see your medium."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday - Present Day

Bits of dirt fell on the area rug as Michael situated the pots on his desk. "How do these smell?" Jay asked handing Michael a freshly plucked flower. Michael breathed deeply and closed his eyes. "I think this is close, what is this? " Michael said excitedly. "This is white Gardenia" Jay said reading a thin plastic label that was sticking out of the green pot that held the bushel of small white flowers. "It says they bloom in spring, that's what you wanted right?" Jay posed, as if waiting for a cue with the plastic container held aloft dropping bits of white loam and dirt. "Yes" Michael said smiling. "Sweet, this is a good looking bunch. I know you said not to ask but whats this for again?" Jay asked for the fifth time. "Ok, if you must know: In the Twelfth grade before graduation Miss Mills helped beautify the school and she and the student council planted a bunch of these flowers." Michael paused trying to remember who was with him that day, he remembered enjoying their company but their names were hazy, he continued "Me and some of the other members got to miss the period before lunch to plant these all over the courtyard." Jay again waited for the story to continue, he turned his head quizzically. "So you just want the flowers in your dorm?" Michael ignored Jay's comments sniffing the flowers and turning knobs on his board. "Well Jay, I will have to catch up with you later- I am seeing someone soon," Michael said, walking to the door as if to go out. But as soon as Jay bid him adieu, which he literally said, " I bid you adieu", Michael turned around and ducked back inside his dorm and locked the door.

Bits of brown soil danced on the floor as the sounds vibrated the room. One hand on the dial the other clutching a fistful of bent flowers pressing against his nose. Michael closed his eyes and breathed deeply, pulling in the sweet smell of spring.

May 2011

David waved his hand up and down in front of Michael's face. "Hello, yoohooo? Come on, man, stop faking." David said narrowing his eyes a few inches from Michael's face. "Are you alright dude?" Michael's eyes widened and he smiled a rye smile. "Hey" Michael thought hard for a moment trying to remember his friends name "Dude." Michael stepped back and turned around looking at the school courtyard. David looked at his friends odd wobbling and staring but decided to go on with his train of thought from before the new Michael arrived. "So anyway I think I am failing drama, and I am not sure what to do, I have never even had a B before dude." Michael nodded inattentively, his eyes jumping from place to place. That couple breaks up, she has a kid, her sister died of an overdose. To Michael it felt like a board game and he was looking at the pieces, he knew their moves. Michael's mind raced as he adjusted, his face plastered with a smile seeing old friends. If it were present day and he saw these people in a store he would have changed pace towards some vacant aisle, but seeing them like this was nice. "Dude" David leaned in front of Michael "What am I going to do!?"

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arthur led the way through an opening along the back wall with beads hanging across it.Â  Harry peered closely at the beads as the two men passed through them.

"Is that--Arthur, are those teeth?"

Doyle grabbed one of the off-white colored strings of beads.Â  "If so that is disgusting."Â  Doyle quickly dropped the string and reached for his silk handkerchief.

Harry peered closer and then straightened.

"Well?" Doyle asked hesitantly.Â  Harry nodded.Â  Doyle tossed his handkerchief onto the floor and continued on down the long hallway.

"You saw quite a few teeth in the ring in your day, I understand," Harry said, grabbing the handkerchief.Â  He pulled at one of the teeth until it came off and wrapped it carefully in the silk.

"I knocked most of them out," Doyle called back.Â  "So I knew where they came from.Â  Those could be from anywhere.Â  Or anything.Â  Disgusting!"

Harry hurried to catch up with Doyle and tucked the handkerchief into his breast pocket as !e walked.Â  Doyle had stopped in front of a large door with a slider in it.Â  He rapped on it three times.

"So teeth you see fly out of someone's mouth do not bother you?Â  I can ask our medium friend who those came from if you would like."

Doyle gave Harry an irritated look and nodded shortly.Â  The plate in the door slid open and a man peered through.Â  "Arthur Doyle and guest," Doyle announced.

"Password?" said the figure behind the door.

"Greenfields," Doyle said.Â  The door plate slid closed and then there was a sound of multiple locks being turned.Â  The door opened and a thin man in a tight fitting black suit stood staring at them.Â  Harry bowed deeply and after a moment the man stepped to the side to let them pass.

Once inside the man shut the door and relocked it.Â  Harry watched automatically, cataloguing the various locks in his mind by type, manufacturer and time and tools required to open them.Â  The man caught him looking.

"You will be released in good time, sir.Â  Once you have what you came for."

Harry stared at the man, taking in the lines of his face, his red hair combed tightly against his head.Â  Like the locks, Harry mentally disassembled the parts of the man's face and catalogued them.Â  His eyebrows rose slightly.

Doyle handed his heavy jacket to the man in the tight suit and gestured for Harry to follow him.Â  The man reached out a hand but Harry waved him off.Â  "I like to keep my coat with me," he said.Â  Then added. "Miss."

A smile crossed the man...woman's face and her eyes crinkled with humor.Â  "Very perceptive, sir."Â  The smile reinforced Harry's conclusion.Â  He looked around the room noting a number of other "men" dressed similarly.Â  "All women?" he asked.

The woman in the black suit bowed slightly.Â  "The Spirits do not always respond well to the masculine energy," she said.

"Quite so," Harry said and turned to follow Doyle.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hold that thought," Michael said as his friend gazed with an exaggerated look of frustration that was common in high-school-age people. Michael walked towards the cafeteria; it was first lunch. He opened the door to a dull roar of petty conversation. Mrs. Ethel was serving fries and tater tots, sweating all the while. Michael felt out of place and self consciously rubbed his jaw, where his usual stubble would be. He was struck by how young they all looked, never remembering appearing this young himself. The crowd made it easy to blend, Michael walked past students waiting in line for their square pizza and chocolate milk, stopping occasionally to fist bump some forgotten friend. He knew the cafeteria well but he wasnât sure where Ellory would sit. Michael sauntered past the band table scanning over the oily faces of self conscious teens tucked away beneath hooded sweatshirts. A fry flew past his head and someone from the student counsel table gave him a sly head nod. Michael walked over to say hello. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWassup brotha?â Sean said while grabbing and slapping his hand in a few different directions. âNothing, just looking for a friend,â Michael responded, nodding in pace to match the enthusiastic movements of his friend. Â âBet, who ya looking for?â Sean stood up and turned around, looking over the crowd. Michael remembered he was the social gatekeeper in touch with all cliques. âEllory.â Michael said, looking hopeful his friend would know her and maybe even have some information he could use to strike up a conversation. Sean spun on his heel, lifted his arm up with a stubby pointer finger extended and then lowered his arm in the direction of a table in the corner of the room. Michael was thrilled, âthanks buddy,â extending his hand for a shake only to have it slapped in a few more directions. Michael thought to himself how fortunate he was to have such a helpful reception, before he could complete the though, though, he heard Sean's voice call out: âHey Ellory, Michael thinks you're cute!â Michael froze and turned around to see Sean smiling cheekily and shooting pistol fingers in Michael's direction. Slowly Michael turned to see the reaction, he was grateful for the commotion of the cafeteria which stayed at a steady roar. Maybe she didnât hear him? Ellory sat a bit slumped, her puffy cheeks bright red and her lips tightly pursed while she stared at Michael, who sheepishly walked towards her. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âHi, Ellory.â Michael said when he was a few feet from her table. Ellory took a bite out of her bologna and mayonnaise sandwich looking straight ahead at the tiny person in front of her. âCan I sit?â Michael pressed on, moving to sit before Ellory could answer, and tiny Allison scooted down the bench to make room. Michael set his elbows on the table, and exhaled -- "sorry about him,â nodding toward Sean who was artfully balancing a cookie on his nose, âI donât know why he said that.â Ellory took a sip of orange juice and made a face while waiting for Michael to continue. He wasnât sure where to start; he had hoped to just sit down and say 'lets be friends" but Seanâs intro threw him off. âWellâ Michael thought quickly âWould you like to go horseback riding some time?â</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some basic things I took away plotted about by points for afterschool murder club:

There is a god who makes everyone love the small town.
In the opening of the story the town is empty and no one seems to care.
The god lives in some statue or gravestone and comes out sometimes.
There is a cult, maybe led by the godâs prophet who protect and promote the town
Some sacrifice (milk) is used to satiate the god. Maybe itâs used by the god??? (Mind control/ influence?)
Other small time gods exist and may be seen 
Sarah goes missing, Michelle turns to Rodney and Daniel for help
TJ joins to clear his name
Could be loads of magic, old god type stuff, alters? Human transformations? Plague? 
Sarah could be killed by the god or someone close to him? (or randomly??)
The schoolâs basketball game is a huge point of pride
Work backwards with the story to layer in some mystery and have callbacks

*Possible timeline for Sarahâs disappearance. 

6:30 Arrives at the Pep Rally to cheer
9:15 Reportedly leaves for Jackie Hughes house, really goes to be with the Teacher Matt.
10:30 Sarahâs mom calls Jackies house to tell Sarah goodnight. Jackie covers for her becuase she knows about her and Mr. M. 
11:00 Mr. Matt calls Jackies house when Sarah doesnât show- Her father picks up. He waits then hangs up. Mr. Hughes takes note. 
11:30 Matt goes to the school to look for Sarah
6am Bread, gem stone, soil and milk left on the front porch of Sarahâs house. 
11:00am Saturday: Sarahs mom starts calling looking for Sarah. Thirty minutes later she calls the police.]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Don got off the bus at the barracks it literally groaned.  A few Gerrie recruits were standing around watching the new meat come off and all three whistled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat is a big boy,â Dapper Din said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âA real hoss,â Stampy agreed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third man just scowled.  A Gerrie company had a set number so sometimes âfillerâ was shoved their way.  But this guy was so fat it was practically an insult from HQ or Recruiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fat man took two steps away from the bus door and then stopped.  He looked around slightly bewildered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou lost, lard ass?â Stampy yelled.  âWe do soldiering in here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dapper elbowed him.  âHe got off the damn bus, didnât he?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat do you think, Cap?â Stampy asked.  The heat was blazing and the fat man already had rivulets of sweat running down his forehead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain just turned and walked back into the barracks.  âGet him settled,â he called back over his shoulder.  âClose to the door so he can leave quietly.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fat man had been watching the exchange and now stepped up to Stampy and Dapper Din.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm supposed to report to my company,â he said nervously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stampy smiled broadly.  âOf course, of course.â  He gestured towards the barracks behind him.  âRight this way.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fat man peered around Stampy and into the doorway.  âIt looks a littleâ¦rustic.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWait until you see the inside,â Stampy said.  âThis is Dapper Din, by the by.â  Din bowed deeply to the fat man.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou mean âDanâ?â The man asked.  âLike Dapper Dan, the hair cream?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stampy laughed.  âWe already had a âDanâ so he got âDinâ.  Porno Dan beat Din here by a day.  Can you believe that?  A day!â  He reached for the fat manâs bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little man stepped back, putting it out of Stampyâs reach.  âI have it.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stampy looked at Din.  Then he shrugged.  âYou are going to do great here.  Letâs go meet your new bunkmate: Beaner.  You are going to do great!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiny Allison giggled into her small pale hands. Ellory started packing her chips back into her lunch bag. Michael noticed that an uncomfortable amount of time had passed. He didnât know how to follow up his invite and he regretted asking. Playing the moment back in his head he cringed. âI remember when you were young you told me you loved horses and that's all I really know about you.â Michael said. Ellory looked at his confused expression and asked âIs this like some sort of dare? Did Sean tell you to do this? This is a weird prank. I donât remember telling you I liked horses and I donât like them anymore. Well I havenât really thought about itâ¦ Horses are alright, but no I donât want to ride one.â Tiny Allsion collected her things and stood up to leave, she was the same height standing as she was sitting, she murmured quietly asking to squeeze by Michael on the bench. âWhat do you like?â Michael said to Ellory ignoring Allisons small hands signaling. âYou sit two rows behind me in English and you never talked to me, even when we had a group project on Chaucer.â Elloryâs tone was one of confusion, after all the school year was close to being done. Allison started to try to squeeze behind Michael and Zeb, a huge ginger kid sitting behind Michael. âWill you let her out!?â Ellory said gesturing towards Allison who half bowed as she walked by crouched over her lunchbox. Michael said sorry and Ellory looked at him quizzically. âHow do I know you arenât being weird or just asking for a dare?â Ellory said looking at Michaels face intently try to decide if she trusted it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat is the function of a friend?â Ellory asked. This seemed like an odd thing to say Michael thought; Ellory was trying to determine his motives and determine if he had anything worth hearing. âWell a friend is a person you do things with because you share common interests.â Michael nodded his head looking for confirmation he had said the right thing. âRight, ok, but why now?â Ellory said as she slurped the last bit of orange juice from the plastic bottle. âWell we are both going to State! It will be good to know someone going in.â Michael mentally high fived himself, that was the right thing to say, not weird or creepy. âYour going to state? How did you know I am going to State? I didnât tell anyone cause well, Allison didnât get in, and I didnât wanna make her feel bad.â Elloy lowered her voice and leaned in looking at Allison who was trying to get the attention of a teacher but was being ignored. Crap think fast Michael, although the truth is safely behind a wall of absurdity he still needed a normalish answer. âI just heard it aroundâ he said cooly. âRightâ Ellory nodded her head trying to remember if she had told anyone at all. She couldnât remember, she may have told Mrs. Henderson. âI like theatre, art, movies, sci-fi, good smelling things like candles, cooking, rain, the backstreet boys and photography.â Ellory listed the items on her fingers like they were written somewhere in that order, they were, her diary page 68 volume 8. âOk, awesome, good list. Good start to this friendshipâ Michael said beaming at his breakthrough. âI have drama at three thirty, its improv day if you wanna check it out?â Ellory said matter a factly. âI will be there!â Michael said just as the bell rang. Ellory stood and collected her things and gave Michael an awkward smile as she turned to leave. â See ya later!â Michael said excitedly, Ellory turned her head and waved. Sean came up and shoved and headphone into Michaelâs ear. âDude listen to this wicked remix I madeâ Michael turned and tapped on his forehead just so to desynchronize from the past and leave his younger self to the unwelcome auditory experience.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Plot: Bess and Harry's child went missing and is believed to be dead.Â  Harry had an experience at some point during a trick where he almost died and he saw her and interacted with her (dreamy wavy underwater experience).Â  Harry is now convinced she is alive or that wherever she is he can bring her back.Â  His obsession tore apart his marriage with Bess who was trying to greave and move on.

Also he and Doyle has a side game/plot running where Doyle tries to find creditable mediums and takes Harry there to try to defunk them by figuring out how they are doing their tricks on the unsuspecting marks.Â  Harry doesnt realize all of the motivations driving his participation in "Doyle's Little Game".

At the next medium they visit however she is actually legitimate.Â  Or at least has some vague, but genuine connection to the Talent.Â  While there Harry can't defunk her and also more worryingly sees his daughter's face in the smoke inside the crystal ball.Â  (Doyle doesnt see anything except smoke swirling around).Â  Harry and Doyle later come back after hours to talk to the medium.Â  She tells Harry that he might be able to pull his daughter back from the Other Side but that it will cost him his life.Â  But the life of a child is full of potential so an adult life cannot just be exchanged for it since it is more "spent".Â  So an adult has to have a much more valuable or meaningful life to exchange for one full of potential.Â  Doyle asks if it goes both ways "potential in exchange for meaningful" and the medium chastises him about "wandering too close to his own heart well" and refers to him as "Life Eater".

Doyle is a man who embraces life to the fullest (like Hemingway but without the stumbling drunk asshole stuff).Â  Â He is not afraid of death, but rather dying after a life without consequence or having his death have no meaning.Â  ("The Light Brigade.Â  Now there were some bastards who knew how to die.")Â  He faces life, his writing, etc. like a boxer facing down an opponent.Â  He can only get the marrow out of the bone by breaking it, he can only become full by drinking deeply, he can only die well by absorbing the world in.Â  It is why he loves expensive habits like pricey cigars, etc.Â  But at the same time he has a practical streak and so while he will toss half smoked cigars into the street nonchalantly in front of his peers he has his valets trained to quietly pick up the stub when no one is looking so that Doyle can finish it later in private.

The medium has aÂ daguerreotype camera that supposedly can measure a man's soul.Â  She takes Harry's photo but only a small portion of his leg shows up.Â  She tells Harry that this is proof of how unimpactfully he is living and that he must increase it somehow.Â  Throughout the story as he does things he finds that certain actions brings parts of his body slowing into theÂ daguerreotype.Â  Thus measuring the weight of his soul.

Side plot about Bess and Harry.Â  She still loves him and thinks he is just grieving still.Â  She left because she thought they were both done with grieving and his sudden insistence on their daughter being alive tore open old wounds and threatened to tear her open for good.

Question:Â  How do you fill up a life enough to make it worth lost potential?

At one pointÂ  Harry meets a soldier (somehow connected to the medium).Â  The man tells him how he survived the war because one man gave his life for their squad on a night "when Death overran reason and humanity."Â  He tells the story of how men were savages against the enemy. But they also slit the throats of their friends to keep them quiet so that the enemy would not realize they were there and move down the line to kill someone else.Â  Men hid under the bodies of dead men.Â  "We did horrible things.Â  Except for Jack Bellamy.Â  Worst human being you would ever have the displeasure to meet.Â  Everything we did that night he had probably done a hundred times over in that shithole he grew up in.Â  He was made for that night.Â  But...but he didn't do any of it.Â  I don't know why.Â  That night he should have led us into Hell.Â  We would have followed him, but he...well it was like he reversed the course of his whole life and the whole world that night.Â  Like he was stretching a slingshot back his whole life, every step towards Hell taking him a bit further and stretching the line.Â  Then that night he let go and flung toward Heaven and inÂ that small 10 mile section of the Line ripped us all out with him.Â  It was the only thing that could have shaken us out of the madness we had all descended into.Â  He yanked us all back."Â  He tells Harry that BellamyÂ "Died that night.Â  Just laid down without a scratch on him and died.Â  Sun came up a few minutes later.Â  Like it was too scared or too respectful to attempt to outshine him."Â  When Harry asks why the soldier is still trying to contact Jack Bellamy through the medium the soldier responds that he needs to know if it was enough.Â  If Jack made it into Heaven.Â  The man also tells Harry the Bellamy's last words were "I brought them all.Â  All back from the bottom of the lake."]]></content:encoded>

<p>Present Day Waffle House -</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell whatâs next?â Professor Mcallister said sipping his black coffee. Michael starred for a moment then shrugged âI havenât figured that out yet.â he said. âI am sorely disappointed in your lack of forethought into this endeavour. Without aggrandising unnecessarily you arguably have more power than anyone in history and you havenât thought past this conversation.â The professor leaned back analyzing Michaels face to try to see how he was taking what was being said. Â âI went through at least twenty different scenarios of alerting some kind of authority, I was close, I mean I called the police but hung up because I â¦ well lets just say I do think there are worse ways to use your machine. That said, I like your motives, I donât fully understand them but they seem well placed.â Eddie nodded gently but then narrowed his eyes intently. âI do not, however like your reckless lack of any type of plan.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael seized the opportunity and interrupted âWell help me then! You know I need it, letâs together think of a way to use this.â Eddie rubbed his thumb and index finger together deliberating. âI donât know that there is a right way to do what you want to do.â He leaned back in the booth deflated. âI am going to do it anyway, help me think of the best way.â Michael said loudly at first but then quieted as a middle aged waitress with blonde hair and a thin face came to ask if they needed anything. Both politely shook their heads and said thank you in a kind, rehearsed, platitude. âI donât really have âno planâ, just not a specific plan really.â Michael said coyly watching as the waitress walked out for a smoke break. âGo on then, tell me what you have so farâ The professor took out his notepad and a number two pencil, moved the syrup covered plate and looked up. âWell, again, itâs not flushed outâ The professor chortled sarcastically, Michael continued âShe needed someone to be there for her when she was dying and I can go back and be that someone. So basically I will go back learn about her and become her friend.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael stopped as the professor scribbled more on his notepad and looked up expecting Michael to continue. âThatâs it!?â Eddie exclaimed. âWell I did say it needed to be flushed out. I donât have all the answers.â Eddieâs eyes bulged âOk listen, there are uncountable number of things to think about, a few of which are plain to me. What will happen as you change the past? Will your memories change? Can you relive a whole life in that machine? What about a ripple effect? How are you affecting people around you? How will you be altered? What if you die?â Michael nodded along thinking a bit before responding. âSome of those are easy, the machine causes people to experience time in the same rate here and in the past. An hour here, an hour in the past. I am not really worried about ripples, no more than I worry about ripples here and now, after all this could be the past and whats the difference between ordering french toast or biscuits? My memories change a bit but slowly, sort of fading and coming into focus, that is kind of how they felt before. People around me arenât going to be too altered-- I am not Ghandi. I think the risk of dying should be lower in the past after all I experience, today is completely unknown, the past seems safer in that regard. And, without being too forward, that slightly offended face cannot hide your exhilaration.â Eddie scowled, but Michael continued. âI think you will help me, how many days has it been since you had a conversation so memorable? You teach about stories with salience and meaning but a comfortable life must be at least partially devoid of the feeling that our actions have impact.â Eddie relented â I will help you, but not because you are right about me, but because you are arrogant and I am afraid of what you will do without being grounded by someone.â Michael smirked â I still think I am right, and I am glad you are going to help me!â Eddie rolled his eyes and shook his head. </p>

<p>The past: Grade 12 lunch, two days before graduation - </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Michael began his landing to the past and he was staring at his plate, with the strong smell of onions and pickles ringing in his head. He looked up as Zeb, the large ginger was snapping at him. The world came into focus and the indistinct roar of the lunch room felt like it had been unmuted. âYou were really studying that burger!â Tiny Allison said while mockingly staring at her bologna sandwich. Zeb, Allison, Zoey and Charles all laughed while Michael scanned for Ellory. The theatre table was in the corner of the lunch room and it made for a good lookout. Michael was happy to find himself there, in his original memory he was with David, Steven and Stevenâs terrible girlfriend who dumped him after cheating on him continually, then she and David got married after she got pregnant with someone else's baby. David took her back even after he found out, but she left him and joined the peace corps. Currently though, Stephanie was sucking face with Steven and David was trying to look away in between bites of pizza. Michael felt a strange sensation on his neck and then reached back to feel a hand dropping an ice cube down his shirt. âHey buddy,â Sean said holding the ice cube under Michaelâs shirt with the appearance of a friendly pat on the back. âHey Seanâ Michael said flatly. Tiny Allison threw a chip at Sean and Sean dipped to catch it in his mouth. âHahaha!â He said proudly while chewing the chip. âCanât beat me at my own game!â Sean exclaimed while walking backwards shooting pistol fingers at the group. Sean just about backed into Ellory who was walking with a tray of tater tots and milk. âWatch it!â Ellory exclaimed and Sean stepped aside and bowed insincerely. </p>

<p>This was step one of the Professorâs plan. Go to a place when she can tell you all about the hard times in her life. Michael and the Professor settled on this after talking about how much time realistically Michael could spend in the modern day laying on his dorm floor. Tell her about a time in your life, Eddie explained, that you needed someone, if sincere then she will likely do the same. Michael thought about the death of his grandfather and was going to talk to Ellory about that. People donât say what they mean professor, they say something general containing it or they donât say it at all, how do I start talking with someone I donât know about something so big? Eddie started talking about the visit to the hospital the first time his daughter overdosed. The way he felt when he saw his little girl covered in vomit stains and tubes. How grateful he was to the nurses who cleaned and cared for her. The sense of relief when she was discharged and the hope he felt as they talked over wendyâs burgers on the ride home. Michael saw Eddie wipe his tears and he felt uncomfortable but also he felt as though he had walked through a door in his relationship with Eddie and he was happy about that. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ok, Michael thought, now is the time. âHey Ellory.â Michael started meeting Ellory on her way to the table. âHi Michael, are you ready for improv today? Itâs the last one of the year and well you have gotten better and Mr. W said if you had more time you could have been really good.â Michael listened to Elloryâs quazi-compliment while standing in the way of the table. Michael opened his mouth to ask Ellory a question but she cut him off âI know TA and Zeb will probably want to start with Freeze again, but usually we do the one with the panel, kind of like a tournament. It works better with more people but Aimee had to leave so we will only have nine.â Michael interjected sensing a slight pause, âcan I interview you?â Ellory looked perplexed? âInterview me? Why? Like all assignments are due already?â Michael had a response thanks to Eddie. âItâs for state. A english professor has it listed for summer work.â âOkâ Ellory said cautiously. <br></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:block {"ref":388} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman slowly walked around them.Â  "Everyone comes to watch, but eventually they want to play."Â  She completed her circuit but remained standing with her profile to them.Â  After a moment, Harry noticed the subtle makeup she was using to make the left side of her face, the side she was showing, more masculine.Â  The woman turned to face them again.Â  Though subtly applied Harry could clearly see the contrast now that he was looking for it.</p>
<p>"So," she said again, letting the words draw out, "here to play or to watch?"Â </p>
<p>"I suppose that depends on which are you doing?" Doyle asked, laughing.Â  Harry could tell his friend was nervous by the way Doyle had retreated to his "womanizer" routine.Â  The woman gave a half-smirk--feminine side of her face, Harry noted.Â  Doyle can feel something wrong, Harry thought, he doesn't know whether to treat her like a man and therefore adversary or a woman and therefore a challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry cleared his throat.Â  "He is watching and I am playing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman's half smirk became a full smile.Â  "Excellent.Â  May I take your coats, gentlemen?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doyle removed his coat and handed it to the woman, but Harry held up a hand.Â  Â "I am quite comfortable.Â  Thank you," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman left her hand outstretched where she had draped Doyle's coat over it.Â  "Players do not wear coats, sir."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry crossed his arms.Â  âI have a number of trinkets in these pockets that I do not want to lose track of in your fine establishment?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Doyle put a hand on Harry's shoulder.Â  "Harry, here is a non-believer.Â  In male nudity."Â  He smiled.Â  "Cannot stand the thought of it.Â  Especially his own.Â  He has four shirts on under this coat."</span></p>
<p>The woman looked back and forth between the two men.Â  All humor was gone from face now.Â  "Gentlemen, perhaps--"</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">"It's all right, Greta," a voice said from theÂ next room.Â  "Let him keep his coat."</span></p>
<p>The woman stepped to the side and gestured for them to enter the adjoining room.Â  "Please step this way."</p>
<p>Doyle gave the woman a wink and gently guided Harry forward.</p>
<p>The next room held a large circular table.Â  A few people in evening wear stood clustered around it, sipping on liquor or champagne.Â  Harry started to step toward the table but Doyle tightened his grip.Â  Â "Give it a chance at least, Harry.Â  Please."Â Â </p>
<p>Harry wrestled free from Doyle's grasp and stepped up to the table.Â  He stared at it intently.</p>
<p>"S'real," said a man as he partially stumbled up beside Harry.Â  He put an arm around Harry and conspiratorially whispered, half spluttered into Harry's ear.Â  "S'real!" he said again.Â  "Let you check under the table and whoever, and, who, and, and what--whatever you want."Â  He crouched slightly so he could wave a leg under the table.Â  He pulled Harry down with him slightly, threatening to topple them both.Â  "Look!Â  Look!Â  No wires!"</p>
<p>Strong hands grabbed the drunk man's and pulled them up.Â  "There where are," said Doyle, his grip tightening painfully on the drunk man's shoulder.Â  "Upsy-daisy, you two cynics."</p>
<p>"No wires," the man said.Â  Doyle released the man.Â  "Look!" the man started to drop down, but Doyle steadied him and then whispered something quietly in his ear.Â  The color drained from the man's face and he appeared to sober slightly.Â  He looked into Doyle's eyes and then retreated back toward another part of the room.</p>
<p>"What did you tell him?" Harry asked.Â  He put a fingertip on the table and pushed down slightly, testing it.</p>
<p>Doyle grabbed aÂ champagne and a whiskey from a serving girl with a tray walking by.Â  She was clearly feminine and her dress was designed to accentuate that fact.Â  "I told him you were the famous magician Harry Houdini," Doyle said absently, staring after the serving girl, watching the sway of her hips.</p>
<p>"Why do I doubt you?" Harry said, holding his hand out for a drink.</p>
<p>Doyle looked back at Harry and then down at the drinks.Â  "Did you want a drink, too?"</p>
<p>"You doubt," said a woman's voice behind them, "because you have not Seen."</p>
<p>Doyle and Harry turned around.Â  A gaunt woman in a dark satin dress stood flanked by two of her androgynous valets.Â  "But you shall," she added softly.Â  "You shall."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rodney shuffled into Mrs. Hamilton's room holding his backpack in one hand and rifling through the mess of papers with the others. She looked up from her mad magazine and shuddered a bit at the site of the consortium of crinkled papers in the worn back pack. "Ya got a method for organizing that trash pile?" Mrs. Hamilton asked shortly. "Sure I do, I know where everything is, I got English in the front and then theirs the social studies in the back, separated, neatly by the shop class binder. P.E. Doesn't have anything much, I don't do math and me the biology teacher, are cool so I just do his work after class or in club." Rodney gestured to the sections as he explained. "You don't do math?" Hamilton said incredulously. "Nah I got people for that." Rodney nodded smugly while admitting to blatant plagiarism. Hamilton thought for a few seconds and worked out who was doing Rodney math for him and made a mental note to discuss it with Mrs. Creswell later. "Alright what do I need from you?" Hamilton asked shortly after taking a drink of pepsi like a shot of whiskey for courage. "3.2 questions and here's my midterm paper" He said unballing a two sheets of paper from separate jacket pockets and pulling a torn half piece of paper from his pack. After another shot of pepsi, Hamilton inhaled and extended here hand to accept the papers. Both where late and neither should have been given any credit but for Rodney just sauntering into any classroom after school and producing anything was an improvement. "Thanks Mrs. H, I am told ya I am gonna try this year, I am doing good now, I am passing Biology!" Rodney winked and straightened his leather jacket collar feeling how he might imagine a firefighter feels after saving a cat or performing cpr. "Ok, thank you Rodney, you keep doing good." Mrs. Hamilton said in a rehearsed and inconsequential tone. After grabbing a peppermint from the "good turn" jar on Mrs. H desk Rodney turned and glided out the door leaving some seven or eight pages from his bag on the desk.

"Alright we can start now I am all good on school work for the day" Rodney announced proudly tossing his bag into the corner. "Nice, lets get started, we set up the board." Mr. S said extending his hand for fist bump. "Ok, I am putting the cards in the folder and we rolled for first go I got a 3 and Mr. S got a 1." Daniel said not looking up from finishing a math problem on a sheet with Rodney's name on it. "Ya know what I am so grateful for this" Rodney tugged on the paper pulling out from under Daniel's palm "That I say you go first." Daniel smiled at Rodneys uncharacteristic gratitude and rolled the dice as Rodney tucked the paper into his coat pocket. "Alright Professor plum kick us off" Mr. S otherwise known as Mr. Green on Tuesday Thursday afternoons, said starting the game. After the first round Mr. S/Mr. Green read the guys an excerpt from an article about a murder in Kansas City. The goal was to identify the killer from a list of suspects listed in the article or made up by Mr. Green. The choices were the step dad, the Boyfriend, the gardener, the teacher or the drug dealer.

The boys contemplated the morbid multiple choice, Rodney/Colonel Mustard guessed first. "Gotta be the teacher, they are always getting away with stuff, they could kill like six kids before someone gets suspicious." Mr. Green laughed at Rodney's clear prejudice against teachers. "Are all teachers killers?" Mr. Green Asked. Colonel responded quickly "Teachers are killers of fun so it wouldn't surprise me if one of em decided to kill more than just fun and happiness. No offense Mr. S your alright, your class is cool, I like biology, we talk about real things like sex and death." Rodney leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms satisfied with his own ideas and conclusions. "Ok, You said she was found in the garden, so I gotta think Gardner is a made up answer. You don't bury someone where you work unless you work in like a volcano. I think it's gotta be the boyfriend, it's always the boyfriend. Something about dating makes people go all neanderthal and forget their frontal lobes." Daniel/the professor said indignantly, seemingly disgusted by the irrationality of infatuated persons. "No offense Dan, but if you had ever dated you would know why people kill." The professor would have been offended by Mustard's comments but they sounded like Rodney's version of sincerity. "Alright, final answers? Drum roll please." Said Mr. Green holding the folded piece of paper with the name of the killer. The boys drummed on the table jostling the game pieces on the board. "It was.... Don Lewis King, the step father." Mr. Green said thrilled with the revelation. " I knew it!" Colonel said. "Yeah right, remember what we call that? Hindsight bias. Murders seem easy to solve when you read about it in the paper. Alright Professor your roll or you can take the tunnel to the kitchen" Mr. Green said after rolling his eyes at the post discovery pomp of Colonel Mustard. "Ya know, I am glad we don't have to solve any mystery the front way around." The professor said tossing the dice across the board. "We don't seem very good at it." The three laughed and carried on playing. The next day Daniel asked Rodney if he jinxed them by saying he was glad they didn't have a real mystery to solve. "Probably, Dan, Probably." Rodney said holding the missing poster.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sarah Jane Williams was a model student, talented athlete and cheerleader. She was blonde and thin with kind features and a persistent smile. She had all the looks of a person who might be shallow and self obsessed but she was neither. She tutored in Social Studies and Math and always remembered everyone's name. She was nominated for homecoming queen but didn't want to take the title from someone else who might enjoy being homecoming queen. She held the door open for people and listened intently when people spoke to her. She once found a mouse stuck in sticky trap and freed it, took it home and made a splint for it's leg. Carl Johnson's truck broke down and she helped him change the tire. Last weeks the biggest news about Sarah was that she forgot to hold the door open for someone, which was the worst thing anybody in the school had to say about her ever. It seems sadly fated that someone so good would be murdered. Almost like she was too good for the world she was in.

Arguably the worst thing about Sarah was Michelle, Sarah's BFF. Who was in appearance similar to Sarah, but in all ways Sarah was nice and good Michelle was not. It would be like biting into one of two identical Oreo's to discover that one is filled with creme and the other toothpaste. Michelle would often say she felt as good as so and so looked. Good day's were people she thought were good looking, the best was a Jane Fonda day. She had only ever had six of them, one in which she kissed Freddie B. after football practice. Bad day's were ugly kids, mostly from school. The worst days were Beth Crocker, Johny Eats A Lot who's real last name was Kapoidlensky, and Theodore Stevens. She was prone to have more bad days than good and she made a habit of informing multiple people of the type of day she was having. One time in Gym Mr. Ryan asked how she was doing and she just pointed to Beth in front of the whole class. Mr. Ryan had to walk out of the room because he was laughing so hard. It was good Beth was deaf, there is a chance she didn't know exactly why the kids were laughing at her.

The fact that Sarah disappeared while Michelle stubbornly persisted was a cruel joke to anyone who knew the both of them. Rodney did not like Michelle as she had once said she was having a "Rodney day" when she got back two F's the same day. Daniel thought she was the prettiest girl ever and once wrote her a note but didn't give it to her because he was thought she may make fun of him and he admitted he couldn't even imagine a kind reply. To Rodney, liking Michelle made no sense, because she had a infinitely nicer near identical counterpart in Sarah Jane. Rodney once said Michelle is to Sarah as a square cow patty is to a brownie. It was weird for the both of them to see Michelle sitting in Mr. S's room and even more strange when she said "Please help, I don't know who else to turn to" through tears clutching a missing poster.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the War to End All Wars (the second one), American soldiers, sailors and marines returned to their small towns or sprawling metropolises with a hunger to make up for the lost years.Â  It was a very serious time for serious people who were serious about wrestling their piece of the American Dream into existence.Â  It was a time of great change and seeking new paths for many people.

Thus it was the Dolan Donaldson found himself on a cool Spring day walking through an apple orchard on the outskirts of a small town in a series of small towns he had seen that year.Â  Officially, Dolan--or The Duck, as his friends called him--was a hair wax salesman.Â  He sold all types of wax: for mustaches and beards, for hair, for bald pates and receding hair lines.Â  The Duck traveled the "Cold Line" which was the path where the weather tended to stay just nice enough that his samples did not freeze or melt (much).Â  It was not The Duck's true calling in life, but it mostly paid the bills and the walking kept him in shape and far, far away from the expectations waiting for him in his own small town.

Periodically, The Duck came across those bastard son-of-bitches that worked for the competitor's hair wax traveling salesmen team.Â  Those were raucous nights filled with drinking and brawling.Â  Like him they were ex-Service men just trying to make their way in the world.Â  And like him they relished a good bust-up where you could walk away or crawl away with a lot of bruisers, but also still breathing.Â  These were serious times and murder even accidental was frowned on because there was a lot of living to do after the Krauts and their friends stole so much, so so much time from the rest of the world.

But, Dolan The Duck, he did not think much about such things.Â  He was an average looking man who had learned that small towns were full of widows and bored housewives and every once in a while an aging but still rambunctious heiress who set him up pretty for a month or two in exchange for a little...work around their country estates.Â  The Duck had met a lot of people in the last few years, yes, he had, and as far as he was concerned he would travel the Cold Line until the good Lord (or enough angry husbands) decided it was time he stopped.

So it was odd even to The Duck when he found himself stopped and looking up at a giant tree standing alone in the middle of a large apple orchard.Â  It was not an apple tree and in truth did not even belong in that part of the country from what he could tell.Â  But there it was and there he was, staring up at it, entranced.

Sometimes a man has to follow his instincts.Â  That had gotten The Duck out of (and into) more than one tight spot so he trusted it.Â  The Duck ran a hand over the bark of the large tree, feeling its roughness.Â  He half expected to get a splinter it was so rough, but he did not.Â  Instead he felt a sense of...something.Â  Something right, but also wrong.Â  As he was mulling over that his hand hit upon a small hole which a closer look showed to be a finger-sized indent that seemed to run all the way into the base of the tree.Â  He was tempted to poke a finger in but had learned from a bunch of bees over near Deerwoodton that holes in trees usually are inhabited.Â  So instead he grabbed a stick and shoved it into the hole.Â  There was resistance at first then gradually it slid in.

After about a bit of pushing The Duck stopped and walked around the tree.Â  He had shoved more than enough in that it should have broken through the other side.Â  But there was nothing there.Â  He went back to the stick which was sitting still about two feet out of the hole.Â  Â So, he pushed again harder.Â  Then harder still but did not find any resistance, nor when he checked, was the stick coming out the other side of the tree.Â  The Duck considered the stick and the tree and the hole for a few minutes then abruptly slammed the heel of his hand into the back of the stick.Â  For some reason, about a foot or so below the hole the stick came firing out and slammed hard into The Duck's balls, sending him to the ground squealing like a stuck pig.Â  The Duck rolled around cursing and spitting for sometime before he was able crawl onto his hands and knees.Â  His box of wax samples was on the ground, luckily unopened, but as he looked he noticed there was probably as best he could tell the most beautiful woman he had ever seen sitting on top of it.

"Hi," The Duck said.Â  The woman looked him over for a minute then stood and walked over to him.

"Janine," she said, offering him a hand.Â  When he took it he noticed how small and delicate her fingers were.Â  The Duck had known a lot of women over the years; in the War, there were the prostitutes who took his money; back home here, there were the women who took his forgettable, average face for a temporary distraction from boredom.Â  The Duck prided himself on being a new Renaissance man because he committed all of their names to memory and recommitted them every night before he went to sleep--because he had lost too many people over in the War to allow him to lose anything else.

But when The Duck touched that farm girl's hand, her in her homespun dress and with her wickedly green eyes, well, he just plain forgot those other girls' names.Â  Hell, he almost forgot his own name, standing there like a fish gulping air, trying to make his mind work right.

"Duck,Â  Donald, The Duck," he said.Â  A wry smile crossed the girl's lips.

"Is that so?" she said.Â  "Well, Mr. Duck, this is private property you're crawling around on.Â  You're more like than not to get shot up around here."

"Duck," The Duck said again.Â  The woman looked down at her hand and he realized he was still holding it.Â  The Duck started to drop it but she tightened her grip.Â  "Sorry for tress'pissin on your land," he said.Â  He was holding her left hand and when he realized there was no ring on it, not even a promise ring, his heart skipped a few beats then made up for it by slamming into his chest, loud and fast.

"Oh, not my land," she said, helping him to his feet.Â  "I just came to steal the apples like you."Â  She smiled at The Duck and that was pretty much it for him.

The Duck had been with a lot of women--mostly after the War when an average looking guy could do alright, but with Janine, no, sir, he waited until their wedding night.Â  He even cried silently for a bit after she was asleep that first night because he knew he had lost the name of every one of those other women.Â  And he knew that the part of him that cared was a lot less than the part of him that wanted to make space for the rest of his life with Janine.Â  The Duck was a serious man in a serious time, but the heart, when it finally wakes up, does not care for anything except whatever magic made it wake.Â  It hungers for the thing that gave it power in this serious world full of serious people since the heart is anything but serious while also being dead serious when it comes to what it wants.

The Duck never did go back to that field and pull that stick out of the hole in that strange tree.Â  Which turned out to be a bit of a mistake.Â  More than a bit, really.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nelson Decker really never had a chance.Â  Or so that is what people who knew him said.Â  There were a lot of cliques at Nelson's school: the preps, the nerds, the drama kids, the jocks, the screw ups, the cheerleaders, and a lot more and then there was Nelson.Â  He fit into exactly none of them.

He could have been a jock because he was big and tough.Â  Once he had even put his fist through a locker to prove that point and the half of the football team who had been getting ready to jump him decided they were late for practice.Â  Â He could also take a beating.

He could have hung with the screw ups but found them boring.Â  Drama kids?Â  Too weird.Â  Nerds?Â  He had considered selling his services as a body guard to them but then he would be following them into some stupid proto-chemical-advanced-quantum-physics-engineering-Advanced-Placement-Class for-smart-kids-with-too-much-time-and-hair-on-their-hands.Â  The metal heads were a one trick pony.Â  The preps would not give him the time of day.Â  And so on.Â  There were all the cliques at Villhana High and then there was Nelson or "Decker" as people called him.

He mostly just held up the wall beside the cafeteria.Â  Once or twice a day he would get bored and mosey off to a class or two, but the majority of the time he spent with himself.Â  Periodically, Vice Principal Smythe would see him cutting class and hanging around the corridor to the boiler room.Â  He would chase him around the school for a bit but Nelson fast.Â  He considered those little truancy runs as calisthenics to keep him sharp.Â  And Nelson needed to stay sharp.

Though he was starting to suspect that Smythe was just doing it for the exercise, too, because he had definitely slowed down once or twice or missed a turn and run on by when Nelson tripped up or got caught on the fence he was trying to scale.Â  Or maybe he did not want to catch Nelson for other reasons.Â  Smythe was the only adult in the school as big as Nelson.Â  On more than one occasion he had stopped a fight simply by holding the two combatants apart by their collars.Â  Once Smythe had stopped a bigger fight between ten kids but that had not been pretty.Â  Everything had been fine until someone got a lucky (or unlucky) punch that put one kid out of the fight but continued on into the side of Smythe's head.Â  It was like a switch flipped in Smythe.Â  A few of the combatants broke off and began to back away, sensing the shift but it was too late.

Nelson had been watching from his usual 2 o'clock cutting spot on the football field bleachers and could see into the main corridor where the fight had broken out.Â  It took about fifteen seconds before every kid was on the ground and it had been like watching an enraged bear tearing through the--

"Watch it," yelled a voice.Â  Someone smashed into Nelson and as expected they got the worst of it.Â  Nelson looked down to seeÂ Michelle Something.Â  She looked pissed.Â  Papers were scattered around her and she began frantically picking them up.

"You walked into me," Nelson said, standing above her.

Michelle looked up.Â  "What?"

"You walked into me.Â  It's your fault," Nelson said suddenly, feeling slightly awkward.

She stared at him and her top lip started to quiver slightly.Â  She stood up.Â  "You know nothing about nothing," she screamed, her face inches from his.

For second he had an almost irresistible urge to kiss her.Â  Nervously, he laughed, but as soon as he did her face twisted in rage and he realized she thought he was laughing at her.Â  He opened his mouth to speak but she slapped him.Â  That was something he understood.Â  He touched his cheek where she had slapped him.Â  He looked down at her and grinned.Â  "Not bad."Â  She slapped him again, three times and the last one actually stung slightly.Â  Michelle looked up at him defiantly and then something in his face made her slap him again.Â  This time one of her rings caught him and sliced his cheek slightly.Â  She shrank back immediately and looked at the trickle of blood on her hand, astonished.

Nelson reached out and took one of the papers she had been in the process of picking up. He wiped it across his face, cleaning off the blood.Â  He held it out to her.Â  "Last one was pretty good, but you have a lot to learn about ass-kicking."

Michelle looked slightly dazed, like a deer in the headlights (or at least, what Nelson expected they would look like since he had never actually seen one and had no car to drive).Â  Still looking him in the eye, Michelle reached out to take the paper slowly then her eyes looked down at it.Â  In that moment something changed in her posture and demeanor, not unlike Smythe that day at the Main Corridor.Â  Like the kids in the brawl, Nelson saw it a second too late.Â  Michelle slammed her fist into his stomach, hard.Â  He doubled over and oof-ed as the air went out of him.Â  Before he could stand up she landed six quick punches along the side of his head.Â  He backed up and put his hands up defensively as she began swinging wildly.Â  He was able to deflect most of them but in spite of her small size she was managing to score a good hit one in every five swings.

Michelle stopped suddenly and screamed, "I hate you!Â  Everyone does.Â  Everyone!"Â  Then she ran off, clutching her papers to her chest.Â  He watched her go and massaged his left arm.Â Â <em>She's a South Pole,Â </em>he thought.

He realized he was still holding her paper, held it up to read, and then looked up after Michelle as she disappeared down the hallway.Â  "Crap," he said softly.Â  For a second he considered following her but then realized he had no idea what he would say.

The paper was a picture of Sarah Jane Williams and he blood was smeared across her face and over the 'g' in the word 'Missing'.

"Crap," he said again.

Harry stared hard at the woman in the velvet dress, sizing her up.Â  Doyle stepped forward and gave a sweeping bow then came up in a fluid motion that caught her hand and kissed it.Â  The woman seemed slightly taken aback.Â  Harry had seen the move a hundred times before and even watched as Doyle practice it for hours with Bess, getting every nuance perfect.

"Gentlemen," the valets said in unison.Â  They began to speak with their words overlapping.

"We are--"

"--to begin--"

"--soon."

"If you--"

"--would be--"

"--so kind--"

"--please--"

"--to take your--"

"--seats."Â  They finished together.Â  The valets gestured towards the large, circular tables where Harry noticed name cards had been placed in front of each chair.Â  A few of the patrons clapped politely and the gaunt woman swept forward around Harry and Doyle to a large-backed chair with a crystal ball in front of it.Â  Her valets pulled out her chair so that she could sit.

Harry looked at Doyle and rolled his eyes.Â  "Everyone is a showman these days," he said.

"Yes," Doyle smiled wryly.Â  "And we are all the worse for it, wouldn't you say?"Â  He pulled out a chair and sat.Â  Harry joined him in an adjacent chair, sweeping his foot casually under the table and finding the wire he knew would be there.Â  He smile over at the gaunt woman as he ran his finger under the lip of the table finding the break in the table he also expected.Â  Harry pulled out a few bills out of his pocket and turned to Doyle.

"Feeling Lady Luck tonight?" Harry asked with a wicked smile.

Doyle quickly ran a hand under the table, feeling for the breaks, then scowled.Â  Emotions warred across his face: disappointment, frustration and a small hint of greed mixed with hope.Â  Doyle sucked his lips against his teeth while he considered then nodded once.

"Usual bet?" Doyle asked.Â  Harry pretended to consider and Doyle's face soured even more, knowing he was being mocked.

"Oh, why not?Â  Eh?" Harry chuckled and put the bills away.

The gaunt woman was speaking.Â  "...spirit slate will reveal the messages to you from The Beyond.Â  But beware the question you ask.Â  For some Spirits take a toll that is not easily paid."Â  A few of the ladies around the table gasped and even one or two of the men looked uneasy.

"I will bet the Spirits take cold hard cash easily enough," Harry mumbled.

Doyle kicked him under the table. "Do be quiet!" he whispered fiercely.

The gaunt woman introduced herself as MadameÂ Zoska, a mystic from the Russian steppes, the thirteenth daughter of a woman who was the thirteenth of her sisters.Â  "Please," she said.Â  "Join hands so that the Spirits can know our voice as one."

&nbsp;

An hour into the seance Harry had stopped mentally cataloging the various cons of Madame Zoska and settled into a mild stupor.Â  It was one of his own techniques he had developed to slow his heart beat and breathing for his underwater magic tricks.Â  While he viewed the dubious Madame's repertoire of tactics as cons, Harry did not feel that his own were.Â  Like any good magician he never professed to be performing anything except illusions.Â  He glanced over at Doyle who was concentrating so hard he was perspiring.Â  His friend was a rational man who wanted desperately to believe, to feel the power of the "World of Spirits".

As the others had used the slate Harry had not been able to make out the faint chalked writing on the walls behind them because the room was dark and smoky.Â  But his keen eyes had caught Madame Zoska's valets in the distance scribbling a word or phrase on the wall behind the current slate user.Â  Harry did not fully understand the properties of the slate that allowed it to act as a somewhat cloudy mirror that caught the faint chalked words behind the slate holder.Â  He had resolved however on his turn to try to break off a piece to take it back to the workshop for further analysis.

"<em>Harry</em>," a young woman's voice whispered, so soft it might have been the wind against the walls outside.

He sat up straighter in his chair.Â  The speaker was obviously somewhere near by.Â  The slate was still a few patrons away from him so he assumed this was just a warm up.Â  He mentally ran through the last few patron's in his mind on their activities before they had gotten the slate.Â  Had they looked flustered?Â  As if someone was "whispering" their name from the Other Side?

"<em>Harry,</em>" said the voice, louder.Â  It was a teenager's inflection. Without turning his head, Harry looked carefully around the circle and then around the room looking for someone with moving lips or close enough to be making the voice.

"Now for your message from the Other Side, sir," said Madame Zoska.Â  "What is your Question?"

"<em>Harry...</em>"Â  The voice was louder now, enough that at least Doyle should have heard it.Â  For a second, he wondered if it was Doyle playing at some sort of prank.

"Doyle?" Harry said slowly.

"Yes?" Doyle opened his eyes, a look of frustration on his face as if he expected Harry to indicate a con the two of them had missed earlier and that he would now pay for.

"It is actually my turn, Madame Zoska," a man wearing a smoking jacket said.Â  He was two seats down from Harry .Â  The spirit slate board had been traveling around the circle, person by person, mark by mark, answering "questions".

Madame Zoska ignored the man and slid the slate in front of Harry using a long stick.Â Â "The Spirits wish to talk to the Non-Believer," she said.

"But, but, I believe!" said the man petulantly.Â  Zoska silenced him with a wave of her hand.

Harry waited to hear the voice again and when he did not he picked up the slate and ran a hand under it checking for wires or any other device then placed it back on the table.Â  The others were staring at him expectantly.Â  Harry pretended to cough and turned his head away to look at the wall behind him.Â  It was empty from what he could tell.

<em>"Harry..."</em>Â A cold feeling crept up Harry's spine and he smiled at the deliciousness of the feeling.Â  He had not felt even a mild emotional response in quite some time.

Doyle put a hand on Harry's arm.Â  "Harry?" he said, concern in his voice. "Are you well?"

<em>"Harry..."Â Â </em>The voiceÂ overlayed with Doyle's voice making it sound like two people were speaking from the same lips.

Harry placed the slate face down in front of him.Â  There was a bowl of chalk on the table.Â  The mark was supposed to use it to write their question, speak it aloud three times and then the circle would chant it three times after that (to give the valets time to do their wall writing).Â  No one had been able to see each other's message because of the way the valets were angling their writing on the wall.

<em>Something angled on the wall perhaps</em>, Harry thought.Â Â <em>Added after we were all seated</em>.

Harry turned to Madame Zoska.Â  "I believe the Spirits already know my Question."Â  Harry slid the slate back to the woman who had just been using it.Â  The man in the smoking jacket harrumphed as it went past him a second time, in the other direction.Â  Beside him, Doyle snickered in spite of himself and then tried to cover it by clearing his throat.

"Would you be so kind, Miss?" Harry asked the woman as the slate stopped in front of her.Â  The woman looked at Madame Zoska, unsure of what she should do at he break in protocol.Â  A few of the valets moved a step closer.Â  "I am curious to know if my answer might be somewhat similar to yours."

Madame Zoska watched the exchange with a thin-lipped smile that did not reach her eyes.Â  After a moment, she nodded to the woman who was holding her hand cautiously above the slate.

"What may I write for you?" the woman asked.

"If you would just hold it up and read it, please, my dear," Harry said.Â  The woman blushed at the familiarity but held up the slate slowly.

"It reads," she began slowly, trying to make out the message.Â  She turned the slate slightly upwards and Harry noted the angle so that he could check the exact position on the wall after the seance.Â  "It reads 'The Bottom of the Lake'."

Around the table everyone, including Doyle, jerked their heads towards Harry.

"<em>Harry...</em>" the voice whispered through thirteen different mouths.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the beginning--and she knew it was cliche--Alicia Hamilton had wanted to save every kid that walked through her door.Â  At her small college in Missouri the faculty painted a vivid and moving picture of the role of an educator.Â  "Educators" made a difference, "teachers" (and she still remembered the way the word was spat out during lectures), no, "teachers" were glorified babysitters holding the next wave of worker bees up until it was their time.

"Hey, Teach," Rodney XXXX said walking through the hallway door.

Yes, in the beginning, Alicia had wanted to save every kid, but after two or three "Rodneys" a year sleeping walking through her classes she was content if they did not stab their eye out with a pencil (accidentally or otherwise).

"Rodney?" she asked.Â  "What brings you in during my lunch break?"

"Glad you said that, Teach."Â  Rodney put an apple he had been eating between his teeth and began thrashing his hand around inside his backpack.Â  "MMad mm mppl mur mu."

They had not taught FullMouth Speak at her small college either but Alicia had picked it up in her first year.Â  "You have an apple for me, Rodney?"

Rodney was still thrashing.Â  "Mmmhmmm.Â  Mum mv me mm mu."Â  Frustrated, Rodney upended his book bag on Alicia's desk, spilling out papers, books and other boy-related knic-nacks.

Alicia shot a look at the clock, watching it tick her precious private time away.Â  "From your mother, Rodney?"

He pulled the apple out of his mouth.Â  "Lost it, I guess.Â  Mom's gonna be P.O.ed.Â  She said you have been single so long that anything hard would get me a good grade.Â  Actually, maybe that was dad."Â  Rodney shrugged, put the apple back in his mouth, and began shoving his stuff back into his backpack.

"MM mot mmpfng mor mu," Rodney said.Â  Alicia made a mental note to spill something extremely cold or extremely hot into Rodney's dad's lap at the next parent teacher conference.

"What would that be, Rodney?"Â  Rodney produced a crumpled piece of paper out of one pocket, unrolled it and handed it to her.Â  He set the apple down on the edge of her desk.

Alicia took the page and smoothed it out.Â  "Math homework," she said.Â  "Excellent!"Â  She tried to shove every ounce of cheer she could manage into her voice.Â  Rodney turning in homework, even math homework to a biology teacher, was grounds for celebration.

Rodney beamed.Â  "Daniel checked the whole thing.Â  Twice!"Â  Rodney shot a quick but obvious glance at the red marker she used for grading.Â  "You can check it now if you want."

"Daniel only checked it...?" Alicia probed.Â  She waited patiently for Rodney to catch up.

"What? Oh yeah.Â  It's not his work.Â  I would never pay my best friend.Â  I got people for that.Â  He just wants to check their work."Â  Rodney winked, clearly missing his own admission of plagiarizing.

Rodney looked down at the half eaten apple on the desk.Â  "Hey, you already got one.Â  Are you..."

Alicia shook her head.Â  "Please, Rodney, you have it."Â  He had it scooped up before the sentence was completely out of her mouth.Â  She scanned over the paper and noted it looked about 75% correct.Â  If Ms. Creswell graded it fairly Rodney (and his mystery homework provider) would be happy.

She noticed something scrawled at the bottom of the page.Â  "Boyfriend, first traffic cop (yes/no?), neighbor?" she read.Â  She raised an eyebrow.

"Whoops!" Rodney said, smiling.Â  He snatched the page, reread the scribbling and then tore out the section of paper that contained it.Â  Alicia noticed that about 2/3 of the page was left.Â  Ms. Creswell had little tolerance for ripped papers.Â  Alicia sighed inwardly, oddly sad that Rodney's parents' hard earned money would go to waste.

"For the Murder Club," Rodney said, shoving the torn slip back into his pocket.Â  "Mr. S's club.Â  We figure out who killed people in crime cases."

Alicia nodded.Â  "I remember.Â  Your after school forensics club."Â  She could see Rodney processing the bigger word, searching through his teen-addled memory for it.Â  Finally, he smiled and nodded.

"Okay, gotta go, Teach.Â  Thanks for the apple."Â  At the door, Rodney stopped.Â  "Don't worry, Ms. H," he said in a serious tone.Â  "Once you get preggers your knockers will blow up like watermelons.Â  Then you can get a date."

Alicia somehow managed to yank the corners of her mouth into something resembling an appreciative smile.Â  "Thank you, Rodney.Â  I cannot tell you how relieved that makes me."Â  She waived the torn, crumpled paper at him.Â  "Thank you for this also.Â  I will make sure it gets to the right teacher."

Rodney gave her a thumbs up and stepped back into the hallway.

"He did not stab himself through the eye," she said to herself a few times like a mantra.Â  It was, all in all, a successful morning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A fine mist hovered over the damp sidewalk as Danial jogged up behind Rodney on his way to school. Rodney was listening to a tape he had lifted from the convenience store by the gas station when he was tapped on the shoulder by his winded albeit exhilarated friend. "Hey *hhhh* Rodney, I am gonna *hhhh* tell Michelle that I wanna go to the dance with her?" Dan said voice shaking from excitement. "You know what I am gonna say, ask Sarah instead, and before you go on telling me how you think Michelle is, well not what she plainly is, I just want to say that I think it's good you want to ask her." Rodney said patting Dan on the back a bit too hard. "Ouch, ya think it's a good idea?" A moment passed as Rodney nodded as if conferring with himself. "Ya, I mean I think the wording sucks, you are going to tell her you want to go to the dance with her? That's not even asking her dude. But it's all the same, I think it's a good idea because she will likely make a public snide comment rejecting you and calling you Janitor or a Bulimic motivator" Rodney said flatly as Dan looked on considering the possibility of this all playing out as Rodney said it would. "She wouldn't do that" Rodney cut Dan off. "She most certainly would do that, and has called you a Janitor before, that time you stayed behind to help Mr. S stack Chairs, she practically yelled it. The one class you talk to her in she cheats off your homework and then moves seats. Honestly I am hoping that whatever magic spell you where put under wears off, cuz I'm starting to feel bad for you. You are like buying a burning house, or you are adopting a poorly disguised skunk that vaguely resembles a cat." Rodney had often spoken poorly of Michelle, he made it a habit of making fun of her whenever she publicly picked on a shy or ugly student. I'm like the Robinhood Bully Rodney would say when called to the principles office. One time in English after Michelle said her day was as good as a special needs students writing, Rodney verbally assailed Michelle and Mrs. Fay just watched and nodded along smiling a bit when Rodney called her unworthy of title most intolerable barbie. Dan knew Rodney couldn't stand Michelle but the two had always kept each other up on their romantic lives, which consisted entirely of who they liked at the time and Rodney's former girlfriend of three weeks who he met at summer camp when he was 14. Rodney strutted across the street towards school. He turned to find Daniel stopped about fifty yards behind staring at the folded paper note. "Come on you chicken! Let's go get you out of this stupid crush for good!" Just as Rodney finished yelling Michelles Dad drove by with Michelle in the car looking upset and unpleasent. Dan started running in the opposite direction of the school as Rodney pointed towards the car making a exaggerated expression of surprise.

It was four blocks before Dan stopped running. Rodney jogged up beside him, backpack bouncing unencumbered by books or assignments. "Well I guess we are transferring" Rodney said as Dan Paced back and forth. "I can't do it, I don't know what made me think I could. Maybe it was that Rocky Movie? Oh that was so dumb of me to write her a letter I am just going to destroy it." Dan said holding the note clutched in his hand. "You can't do that, It's bad luck. Everyone knows you can't throw away a love note, its as bad or worse than wearing a dead mans hat." Rodney consoled his panicking friend. "Well what do I do with this? I can't let her read it, I can't let anyone read it!! I quoted Rocky and wrote her a poem. I know you want to make fun of me but save it for after this crisis I am close to emancipating and moving to Mexico to a life of cactus farming." Dan's voice cracked and he inhaled sharply and irregularly. "Ok, don't worry alls you have to do is keep the note in a hidden place until the feelings subside for the person and then it becomes just a piece of paper again and then you can destroy it, but only with fire and not when the moon is full." Rodney often cited odd cures to everyday problems. For example if your shoes come untied perpetually or zippers get stuck reset all your clocks to help re sync you to your proper timeline. "I don't want anyone to find this, my mother is nosy! She would read it and probably tell Michelle's parents or something!" "Well were do you want to put it?" Rodney asked? Dan thought through and dismissed many places, anywhere with people might go was too dangerous. "Ok, uhm how about the old tree fort? I can put it there no one goes there and you told me before cursed items are best stored high up." Dan looked to Rodney for confirmation. "Ok, that would help contain the vibes. I like this, skipping first block! Hey ya wanna skip through lunch? We can go to my house if ya wanna." Rodney said but Dan hardly heard he just wanted to get the note out of his clammy hands.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harry jumped to his feet.&nbsp; His chair flew backwards, crashing into something.&nbsp; His emotions were far from delicious now.&nbsp; Thirteen hands raised and pointed a finger at him.

"<em>Believe...</em>"

The hands dropped and the group of men and women bowed their heads.&nbsp; Then around the table people began to look around.&nbsp; Most turned to look at him, but not in unison this time.&nbsp; A few people shook themselves lightly.

"Harry?" Doyle said.&nbsp; He stood up and walked over.&nbsp; "What are you doing?"

Harry kept staring around the room.&nbsp; He realized his hands were clenched into fists and willed them to relax.&nbsp; He stared hard at Doyle who took an involuntary step back.

"Harry?" Doyle said carefully.&nbsp; He reached out for Harry but stopped halfway to him.

Harry looked around the table at the faces.&nbsp; Most regarded him with curiosity tinged with a touch of the fear you might feel at crossing paths with a rabid dog.&nbsp; Harry looked at Doyle who was obviously concerned, but only at Harry's strange behavior.&nbsp; Then he looked at Madame Evrelsa...and he knew.

"We will be leaving now, Arthur," Harry said.&nbsp; He walked out of the room.&nbsp; He heard Doyle behind him making apologies.&nbsp; Harry ignored the conversation.&nbsp; He noticed a door that looked like it might lead to the street and pushed it open.&nbsp; It led into an alley and Harry stepped out and felt the cold air hit him.&nbsp; He walked over to a garbage can and sat down heavily on it.

Doyle emerged a few moments later from the doorway.&nbsp; He scanned the alleyway as he did, finding Harry but looking past him assessing the surroundings.

"You know how to make an exit, Harry," he said, sitting down on the garbage can next to Harry.&nbsp; He pulled a cigar out of his jacket pocket and lit it.&nbsp; He pulled a small flask from another pocket and offered it to Harry.&nbsp; When Harry did not move to take it he shoved it back into his coat.

Doyle sat silently for a while and smoked.&nbsp; He watched Harry carefully.&nbsp; Finally, he said, "Did&nbsp; you know that when I was a boy I had a terrible fear of chickens?&nbsp; Vicious, little things.&nbsp; Always pecking and squawking.&nbsp; Peck.&nbsp; Squawk.&nbsp; Peck.&nbsp; Squawk."

Harry stared at the wall across the alley.&nbsp; After a minute he took a deep breath and smiled slightly.&nbsp; "How did you get over it?"

Doyle took another puff on his cigar.&nbsp; "I got more scared of elephants."

Harry held his hand out and Doyle reached into his jacket, retrieved the flask and handed it to him.&nbsp; Harry took a drink but did not give it back.&nbsp; He took a second drink.

"It is supposed to be mice.&nbsp; Otherwise the 'elephants' does not make sense."

Doyle chuckled and then they sat in silence for while longer.

"Why did you pick that joke, Doyle?" Harry asked.

"It is Bess's joke.&nbsp; Her favorite one, though she blunders it every time.&nbsp; I thought it might shake you out of whatever ill humor suddenly took you."

"It is her favorite joke, but it is not her joke," Harry said softly.&nbsp; He took another drink and passed the flask back.&nbsp; "Odd that you would choose it just now."

Doyle shook the flask and scowled.&nbsp; He tucked it back into his jacket.&nbsp; "So are you going to tell me what our host, Madame Evrelsa did to insult your honor so thoroughly that you felt compelled to smash up her furniture and leave halfway through what was, by the by, turning out to be a very entertaining evening.&nbsp; The young woman you scared with the spirit slate was on track to become the next Mrs. Doyle.&nbsp; That was true love in there."

It was the closest Doyle would come to saying that Harry's behavior had unnerved him.

"We have to go back," Harry said.&nbsp; "After the rest are gone.&nbsp; We need to talk to her.&nbsp; Alone if possible."

"I would prefer to go back in and find my future ex-wife."&nbsp; Doyle was smiling lightly but there was an edge to his voice.&nbsp; Harry realized that somehow Doyle knew also, maybe at a primal level.&nbsp; He looked like a man at the mouth of a very deep cave who did not want to go it but would reluctantly if his friend did.  "She probably has already left with that fool she came with.  But I suppose we would check."

Harry stood and brushed the dirt off of his overcoat.&nbsp; His hand was still shaky despite Doyle's alcohol.&nbsp; He took out the bills he had been flashing at Doyle earlier in the night. "Doyle, surely you of all men realize that our dear Madame Evrelsa is the most despicable kind of charlatan."&nbsp; He tossed the bills to Doyle who caught them with surprise.  He stared at them then folded them into his pocket slowly.

"This is a new development," he said softly.

"Yes," Harry said.  "She is the genuine article marauding as a fake."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory pressed her thighs with her hands, the jeans made a textured sound as her palms passed over. Michael clicked his mechanical pencil trying to get the lead to come out long enough to write but short enough not to be broken. Pens were a college utility Michael realized he appreciated after finally after etching a title onto his paper with uneven markings. The lunch room was empty except two lunch ladies wiping down the stainless steel platters. "OK, so this is for a biography piece of some one we want to know better" Michael said; Ellory's eyebrows lifted slightly and her sneaker squeaked a bit as she adjusted. "That's nice, I hope there aren't too many questions, I don't want you finding out I am crazy" Ellory snorted a bit laughing and lifting her hand to cover her nose. "No, not too many!" Michael assured her while trying to think of a way to say something like 'your not crazy'.

"Question one, what do you want to do before you die?" Professor Mcallister urged Michael to start with that question, their are so many layers to it he proclaimed. So Michael decided he would start there, after all Ellory thought she was answering with 60 years of things to come, and not two and a half years. It didn't sit well with Michael, a wave of worry passed through him, maybe she would somehow know that he knew she would die soon. Of course, Ellory didn't figure out Michael was visiting from a future time laying on dorm floor listening to sound waves permeating time and pressing past to present. "I want to paint a whole gallery's worth of paintings. I want to be in a movie, probably more than one, but at least one. I think I want to make the world a better place, by like spreading happiness. And I really want to build a big house with room for all my friends, it would look like a couple houses all joined up." Michael wrote quickly as Ellory gave her list of desired accomplishments. He paused for a moment trying think of a way to get one of those done. Eddie had told him that the list you get isn't what people want to do so much as how they want to be known.

"Ok, good list question 2. When were some times in your life when you really wish you had someone their for you, but didn't?" Michael asked. The question didn't feel as natural as Michael had hoped, the professor warned him the question would be hard to answer. "I.. uh... well... I think there were a few times. We all have a few right?" Ellory stammered a bit but she thought hard about how to answer. "I know I had several, like when my Grandfather died, I was at soccer practice when my mother told me. I started to cry as we walked to the parking lot." Ellory's voice trailed off a bit. "My coach came over and put his arm around me and assured me. The other kids laughed, and I wanted to hit them. I am glad I had coach Badget, so I guess I had some one!" Ellory looked at Michael who was hurridly scribbling. "And can you tell me the date when this happened?" Michael asked, his excitement with his progress making him look a bit too happy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["My dears, let me make my meaning clear. I am not asking you to move. I am telling you to step aside before my man kicks this door in. I do not want to catch you two with it."

Doyle's driver held his hand against hand against the door easily keeping it open even though two of the female valets inside struggled to push it closed.

He raised an eyebrow at Doyle.

"Let's give diplomacy another moment before violence," Doyle said to him.

"We have sent someone for help!" One of the valets yelled.

"Police or Bruisers?" Doyle said. "I am on excellent terms with the bosses of both in this district."

Harry stepped forward. "Mademoiselles, you are dressed as men. You are in league with a fraud. Should the police arrive they will take you both in custody to the men's facilities and it will be some time before they turn out the truth of your situation."

There was a momentary pause then the struggle against the door increased voraciously to the point where Doyle's man had to push slightly harder.

Doyle scowled. "Your diplomacy skills are impeccable, Harry."

He nodded to his driver. "Kick it down but try not to damage the ladies."

The struggling against the door stopped. It opened. One of the valets stood framed in it, holding a lead candlestick.

"My lady has a derringer."

Doyle produced a large revolver from his jacket and held it out to the valet grip-first.

"Excellent.Â  Then she will know how to fire this.Â  She can borrow this while we are here to ensure our good manners."

The valet looked back into the room and then took the revolver between two finger. She handed it to someone behind the door and stepped aside slowly.

Doyle stepped in followed by the other two men. He handed his coat to the woman behind the door who instinctively started to lower the gun to take it then realized what she was doing.Â  Her cheeks flushed and she angrily raised the gun quickly.

Doyle gave her a wink and moved deeper into the parlor.

"Madame Evrelsa, where are you, my dear?"

The valets, not the one carrying Doyle's gun, stepped forward. "She has left through a bolt hole we have--"

"Enough!" Harry roared. Everyone, including Doyle, turned to look at him. Harry pointed at the valet. "You are Evresla. You have the same build and mannerisms. I assume you all take turns playing the medium to the marks. I do not care about that. I want to know what happened at that table tonight."

The valet stared at Harry then smiled wanly. "Perceptive. Yes, tonight it was me. But I do not know what you believe you saw or heard that would make you come into my home so forcefully. We are entertainers and illusionist like you, Mr. Houdini."

Harry's patience was fraying. He opened his mouth to speak but before he could the woman called Velsa sighed and gestured for the men to follow.Â  She handed the gun to Doyle.

"It isn't loaded, is it?"

Doyle tossed it to his driver. "It is not even real, my dear.Â  Still I would prefer we forgo any attempts at blunt force with the candle sticks."

"I'll s'ay 'ere," Doyle's driver said, slipping the pistol into his jacket pocket. "Yell if 'ou need me," he looked darkly at the valets around him. "I am real."Â  He looked over to Velsa.Â  "Mr. Doyle is a favorite around the Club. Mind not to damage him."

Madame Evrelsa, or Velsa, took them further into the parlor and then through a false door that even Harry's keen eyes had missed on their first visit.

Velsa and the other valet passed through a small sleeping chamber with five rough cots along the far wall. They stopped in front of a door with cryptic writing on it.Â  Harry peered closely at it while Velsa retrieved a key from her waist coat.

Doyle looked back at the cots.Â  "So, you, ladies, all--"

"Leave off, Doyle," Harry warned and Doyle leered at him.

Velsa opened the door and gestured for them to enter. Doyle and Harry peered inside to make sure it was not an abandoned elevator shaft or some other trick. The women did not seem like criminals but people did unexpected things when they felt backed into a corner.

Velsa groaned and pushed past them to step into the room. She twirled around to show them it was safe. She pulled a small camera off of a shelf and set it on a stand.

"That is what?" Doyle asked walking over to study it.

"A Soul Seer. It is what Spirits told me during the play to share with you both. Right before they asked me to kill you both."Â  She pulled a small derringer out of her pocket and pointed it at them.]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

"What?" Harry said.Â  Doyle tensed and instinctively move a half step in between Harry and Velsa.

Velsa laughed richly and pulled a cigarette out of one pocket.Â  She put the derringer to the cigarette and pulled the trigger.Â  A tiny flame flare out and lit the tip of the cigarette.

"Cute," Doyle muttered.

"Is that a daguerreotype?" Harry said, moving forward to examine the box.Â  It was a black and wooden with a handle on it and a shuttered lens made from bronze on the front.

Velsa put a hand on it possessively.Â  "We call it the Sadness."

Doyle looked at Harry.Â  "Well?"

"Open it," Harry said sharply.Â  "Please," he added.Â  He nerves were frayed but there was no need to discard decorum and basic human gentility.

Velsa ran a finger down the center of the box then pushed a small claspÂ  with her finger tip.Â  The box slowly opened itself out.Â  Harry bent down to inspect the camera.Â  It was old and worn.Â  The paint was flecking off the sides Harry could see as he examined it closer.

"There is no manufacturers label," he noted, running a finger along the side.Â  "Where was this made?"

"This came into my family through my great uncle.Â  He was a mercenary and brought it back from one of the many wars he stumbled drunkly through," Velsa replied.

"Is that true?" Doyle asked.

"Is anything," Velsa responded.Â  "Would you like to see how it works, gentlemen?"

"No," said Doyle.

"Yes," said Harry at the same time.

"Are you serious, man!?" Doyle thundered.Â  "You drag me in here--again--past a row of teeth curtains.Â  To the spookiest evening--what are we doing here?!"

Harry sat down at the table and faced Velsa.Â  "Playing the real game."

"Then by all means let us play," Doyle said, gritting his teeth.Â  He pulled Harry out of the chair roughly and sat down in his place.Â  "I will play, mystic."

Velsa gave her queer smirk and placed a hand under the table and withdrew a deck of cards.Â  Harry came to stand beside Doyle's chair as Velsa began shuffling the cards very slowly.Â  She laid one out.Â  Shuffle, card, shuffle, card.Â  After the third shuffle she spread the cards out in front of Doyle.

"One from you as well."

Doyle selected one at random. Velsa pulled the other cards back, placing them under the table.Â  She turned over the first card.Â  It was a skeleton with a scythe and a hood.Â  It was leading a long line of men and women into a field.

"The Reaper has harvested many in your name," she said.Â  "In war...and one..."Â  Velsa looked at Doyle uncertainly.

She turned the next card.Â  It was a soldier sitting against a rock on a battlefield covered in bodies and weapons.Â  A broken flag stood nearby and a sword was clutched in the soldiers hand.

"The Broken Man," Velsa said.Â  "He has taken much and lost more."

Velsa pointed towards the last two cards--one she had drawn and the one he had chosen.Â  "Choose from my story or yours."

Doyle looked at Harry who shrugged.

"A card face down can stay unseen by all," Velsa said.Â  "But my card turned and seen will be a part of the story of you," Velsa said.Â  She leaned forward.Â  "I will be come a part of you.Â  Choose now, Soldier."

Doyle tapped Velsa's card.Â  "I know my story.Â  Let us see yours."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doyle flipped the card without hesitation and picked it up.Â  He showed it to Harry and put it on the table in front ofÂ  Velsa.

"The Broken Sword," she said.Â  She tapped it lightly with one long tapered finger.

"What does it mean?" Doyle asked.Â  He was wearing his confident smirk, but Harry could sense a slight unease in his manner.

Velsa looked at the card again, her performer's mask dropping momentarily.Â  "I do not know."

"Pardon?" Doyle asked.

Velsa's mask was in place.Â  "Ah the Broken Sword is...a man of steel, broken in soul."

"That is ludicrous," Harry laughed.Â  "You made that up just now."

Velsa ignored him.Â  She picked up the flash stick and held it forward and triggered it.Â  There was a loud snap and a brilliant flash.Â  For a moment, Harry was blinded then he heard Doyle whispering softly beside him.

"No...no...no..." Doyle said in horror.Â  Harry followed Doyle's hard stare across the room where the daguerreotype camera was projecting a moving picture out of its backside onto the wall.Â  Somehow the lights in the room had dimmed considerably.

In the moving picture was a scene of carnage and chaos.Â  Men stabbed at each other with bayonets and long, wicked-looking knives.Â  One man grabbed another man and dragged his knife across a man's throat spilling only to be shot in the back by another man.Â  Velsa looked away and covered her eyes.Â  Thankfully, there was no sound but the scene was vivid and life-like.Â  Harry slowly walked forward and pushed on the wall making sure a window into Hell had not opened up before them.Â  The wall was solid.

"Hell?" Harry asked Velsa.

"The War," Doyle said softly.Â  "My unit.Â  A terrible, terrible mistake."

As Harry looked he realized he realized he could make out different uniforms on the men.Â  Slowly, the men killed each other off until there were only a few struggling and then only two combatants.Â  The rest lay dying or dead.Â  The two men faced off warily, both held long knives drenched in blood and gore.

"In the end there was just the two of us," Doyle whispered.Â  "The way it had always been really.Â  Our own personal War."

As Harry peered at the moving figures he noticed that one resembled a younger Doyle.Â  The young Doyle was strangely fresh-faced but also had a look a terror and unbridled rage in his eyes.Â  The two men suddenly charged each other, exchanging blows and swiping with the knives.Â  Each landed a few shots or scored superficial wounds but nothing decisive.Â  The broke apart, stepping over bodies as they watched each other.Â  Then unexpectedly the man opposite young Doyle laughed.Â  Doyle laughed manically beside Harry then covered his mouth.Â  When Harry looked back to the moving picture he saw that younger Doyle was also covering his face trying to stifle a laugh.

"That bastard," Doyle said as he got himself under control, but it was said with tenderness.Â  Young Doyle's opponent knelt down and stabbed his knife into the ground and stood back up.Â  He lifted his hands slightly to show they were empty.Â  He stepped away from the knife and raised his fists.Â  Young Doyle looked down at his own knife and then tossed it a few feet away.Â  He raised his own fists and nodded, smiling.

"That is insane," Harry said.

Doyle chuckled.Â  "We were both amateur pugilists.Â  It seemed like the right place at that moment."

Both men circle again and moved until they found a spot relatively clear of bodies and discarded or dropped weapons.Â  The older man inched forward and drew a long line in the dirt with his foot.Â  Younger Doyle stepped forward and placed his foot on it and his opponent did the same.Â  Harry noticed that Doyle's opponent was an older man, maybe a career soldier.Â  Then the two men began exchanging blows.Â  Harry was fascinated as both men dodged and weaved and slung the fists at each other but rather than just brute punching both men moved as if in a fixed and violent dance.Â  They were artists.

"I never saw you fight," Harry said.Â  "You were good."

"I am still good," said with annoyance.Â  "He was better though, in so many ways.Â  But unlucky, too."

Doyle gestured toward the scene on the wall as the older man, young Doyle's opponent slipped.Â  He fell on his butt and looked up at young Doyle in surprise then both men laughed.Â  Young Doyle stepped forward and extended a hand and helped his opponent up.Â  The men took their places on the line and as they began exchanging blows again Harry could see the looks of sheer joy on both men's faces.

"You are smashing the Hell out of each other..." Harry said in amazement.

"Yes," Doyle said, wistfully.Â  "Life made sense in that moment.Â  Simple."

Young Doyle's opponent stepped back from the line and looked into the air.Â  Young Doyle spun around and looked up.Â  Both men could obviously hear something and Harry could see the terror on their faces.Â  Suddenly, Doyle's opponent charged forward tackled him, covering him with his body.Â  A massive explosion rocked the scene and bright, blinding white light seared Harry's eyes.

"No!" Doyle yelled, standing.Â  He rushed the wall and slammed his fists against it.Â  He turned back to Harry.Â  "Help me!"Â  He began trying to shove into the wall.Â  "Help me, God damn you!"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harry grabbed Doyle and pulled him back before he broke a hand.

Doyle collapsed, staring helplessly at the wall.Â  The dust had started to clear in the scene on the wall.Â  Young Doyle was holding the older man who was now missing an arm and most of his left leg.Â  Young Doyle was screaming but the lack of sound made it somehow more terrible.

The older man was moving his lips.Â  Young Doyle moved in close to hear him, cradling his burned, destroyed body.

"What did he say to you?" Velsa asked Doyle quietly.Â  She was standing in front of the scene on the wall.

Doyle mumbled something.Â  He was crying silently now.Â  "Mein Kleiner Junge," he said after moment.

"My baby boy...little one, maybe," Harry translated.

On the battlefield, the older man brought his hand up and caressed young Doyle's cheek, trying to wipe away the tears.Â  His hand left a trail of blood.

"No tears, my Little One," Doyle said.

The burned man pulled something from his inner coat pocket and handed it to young Doyle.Â  He looked at it and laughed in spite of himself and said something back.Â  The older man laughed and then clutched his stomach in pain.

"What--" Harry started.

Doyle reached into his shirt and ripped something off of a necklace.Â  He handed it to Harry.Â  It was an old battered rank insignia.Â  "We were mirrors, he and I.Â  My squad faced his and the two of us often had the same watches.Â  So we spent most of the time we were in that Hell hole staring across No Man's Land at each other."

The burned man gently pushed a fist into young Doyle's chin.Â  "The squad use to hold boxing matches with other squads up and down the trenches.Â  He must have seen me fighting once because one night he began doing that fake punch to his own face and pointing to me.Â  That was how we starting becoming more than enemies."Â  Doyle laughed softly.Â  He walked over to the wall and touched spot where the burned man lay.Â  "I thought he was challenging me.Â  Then the next day in a match I took a hard one on the chin and was down for three days.Â  Next watch we shared he did the same gesture on his own face and then pointed at me and shook his head."Â  Doyle caressed the wall tenderly.Â  "He was not wrong.Â  I was leading with my chin unconsciously.Â  Leaving it wide open."

Harry held up the insignia.Â  "This is not German."

Doyle looked back at Harry.Â  "No, it's English.Â  I had lost one two nights before on a raid into their territory.Â  He must have noticed mine missing when we shared a mirror watch the next night.Â  Maybe they had extras lying around.Â  We both lost a lot of men in the middle, he would have had spares."

In the battle scene, young Doyle gestured around at all of the destruction and dead bodies and the older man laughed hard but immediately grimaced and clutched his stomach.

"I told him he did not have to go to so much trouble to return it," Doyle said.Â  "'Next time, you come get'," Doyle said in the present, softly repeating the words of his opponent in the scene on the wall.Â  "'No make old man walk so far'."

The older man shuddered and young Doyle hugged him closer.Â  Both Doyles--present and past--started shaking their heads frantically.Â  Harry looked at Velsa sharply to see if it was a repeat of the group possession from earlier in the night but she was only staring at the wall curiously.

Doyle's opponent's eyes glassed over and some bubbles and sputum came out of his mouth.Â  Young Doyle wiped it away carefully with his hand and closed the man's eyes then he buried his face in the older man's shoulder.Â  He rocked slightly and Harry could see that the younger man's body was being racked with sobs.

Harry turned to say something to Doyle when Velsa pointed at the wall.Â  "Look."

On the wall, the burned man's eyes were open again, full of life. He was staring straight ahead as if he was looking into the room where Harry, Doyle and Velsa were.Â  His eyes moved from one to the other but stopped on Doyle.Â  Doyle's opponent mimed punching his own chin and smiled then he slung his hand out in front of him.Â  Something sailed out of his hand and through the air and Velsa, Harry and Doyle jumped backÂ as there was a sound like a rip.Â  Something clattered onto the floor and slid, coming to a stop in front of Doyle's feet.

The scene on the wall flickered and for a moment the older man was whole and unburned.Â  He had young Doyle cradled in his arms now and was patting the younger man's back, speaking softly.

"I go," Harry translated.Â  "You safe now.Â  I go."

Doyle stared down at the item but made no move to pick it up.Â  "That one, however, is German, Harry," he said in wonder and horror.

"The Broken Sword," Velsa said softly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,

This is Ellory. I wanted to thank you for writing my story.

It is a rare and great and terrifying gift to be able to see yourself--after you are gone--through someone else's eyes. It is also strange to see the parts of my life that mattered to someone else, the moment when I became a part of their personal narrative.

"I saw a girl die today. There was a guy there holding her. I think they knew each other."

"I saw something sad today. She was so young, it made me think about Katie."

"You're not going to believe what happened to ME today. I saw this girl die. It was crazy. I am so fucked so fucked up right now."

And so on.

You know (maybe you do actually) I read this book once about guardian angels. It was heavily religious (I skimmed a lot ð), but one thing I noticed was that in every case if you stripped away the "halo of light" crap each "angel" could easily have been someone who was right place right time and their personal story suddenly became coopted and is owned by the victim's. But that is not what happened here is it.

His wasn't happenstance and he just happened to be there. He changed his entire story up to the point just to become a bit player in mine for a short time.

On this side things are...gray. Memories they slip away from you like you are being cleaned of all that is painful and all that is joyful. All of the peaks and valleys of life leaving only those moments where I was someone else's story. Those seem to linger the longest.

I am not sure who you are or where you are or even how or why we are connected. Maybe I am imagining all of this as a defense against whatever is coming next. But I remember things again once you do whatever it is you are doing wherever you are at. They are his story but I remember being there. I remember ME.

Don't worry about getting my story right because I have lost so much of it anyways. Just find my moments through his eyes and bring them back to me for a little bit longer. Help me say "Fuck the natural order!" for a little longer.

I think you are probably a painter because beside me here is a painting of me. It colors in a little more every bit of time that goes by (there is nothing here that resembles "time"). The memories come and with them more of me. Me as you see me and as he saw me. Maybe in the end I will be inside the painting like Dorian Gray looking out.

Be my "angel" here for a while longer. Fill in the painting. You KNOW my story, somehow it is inside of you even though I get the feeling we never met. So what if you get it wrong and change it later. It's fun for me to be someone else for a bit knowing you will come back and make it right eventually.

Finish the painting. Give me back my story.

PS: Oh and can you take some creative license and let me die in a better outfit. If I had known I would spend eternity in this I would have never worn it that day. You know the one I want. I always joked that I could die in that. But better shoes. If you are a woman then you know why I don't want to spend eternity in those. And if you are a man and you put me in those shoes I swear I will find a way to make sure someone kicks your ass when you get here someday! I am a ghost--don't fuck with me! ð

P.S. Thank you whoever you are. I know you are not an angel but somehow for a little bit you get to be a part of what remains of my story and I am grateful.

- Ellory]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most continuous conversations of excitement have an interplay where one party feeds of another and both urge the other on. Ellory and Michael's conversation sparked towards one topic and then slowing on another. Ellory loved to talk about herself, though she often didn't in daily conversation. "How many siblings do you have?" Michael asked "Just me" Ellory said both thumbs extending from closed fist towards a goofy pose. Michael knew this already from preliminary research but he thought it might tell him something about how she felt about being an only child.

"If you could have one super power what would it be?" Michael had often used this question to get to know people, super powers are a fantastic notion but even the most hardened adult glimpses some whimsy about super speed or strength. This marked the end of the formal fact finding mission. Michael had six hard dates to visit in Ellory's past. One: When her Grandfather died.

Two: Her parents divorce, the worst of came when her mother found the notes Charles had written. She held the family's lab and sobbed on the floor. "It was hard. I wanted to be mad but I kept getting choked up. It feels silly, and I hate that cause it was really bad, but I felt like I couldn't think about long, I would try to think of something nice then I would be reminded that my family is kinda not there." Ellory said kind of slumped in her chair.

Three: Zoe the lab's death. "She was kind and dumb and had the custest little way of putting her head on your lap. I remember her crawling towards me when I was upset as a kid hiding underneath my bed. She scooted next to me and just lay there. It was nice." Ellory's eyes watered and she smiled a bit thinking of her companion.

Four:The entire fourth grade, Ellory was bullied for having glasses that year and her mother decided to homeschool her for most of the year. Ellory remembers looking out the window as the kids got on the bus. "I made a lot of art that year and took apart my bike several times. It still feels like it might still be going on the way the days dragged on."

Five: Summer. The summer between Ellory's Freshman and Sophomore year her ex BFF told her she didn't want to see her ever again. Ellory had remained and Frankie became cool and relevant. Ellory liked dorky jokes and comfortable clothes and Frankie liked the way other people looked at her and thought about her. They were close, ever since T ball in the first grade. When Frankie didn't want to go to camp because she was scared Ellory put her hand on her shoulder and offered to be her tent mate. Now Frankie makes fun of girl scouts. Ellory cried, when Frankie standing with Jake Markobs and Stefanie Sims pointed to Ellory's dirty shoes and unkempt hair and said "You know if you are overweight you got to work extra hard" Michael made a note to find out all the times Frankie skipped class and tip of Tom the Security Guard who loved busting punk kids.

Finally six: Something unknown. Ellory hadn't said anything in particular but something in between her words made Michael feel like there was another specific time Ellory needed someone and he was going to find it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael peeled himself from his bed and with blurry vision began to rifle through his sock drawer. His hand clumsily pushing to the bottom of the drawer in search of a clean pair. The crinkling sound of paper may have failed to register in the early fog morning if Michael had not jammed so many under shirts and socks into a pile such the drawer wouldn't close. Upon resorting the stack of clothes some envelopes could be seen. The first was labeled E1. Michael unfolded it, sat on his bed and read it.

Hey Michael,

I know you are probably having a blast at summer camp! The pictures make it look like fun. I saw the image of you holding up that scorpion, I can't believe that was in your sleeping bag! I would loved to see that up close, admittedly not in my sleeping bag. I saw your tan, ow ow. But seriously you should wear sunscreen, as a chronically paper white person I have an appropriate fear of the sun. They are your burns but be careful, ya know?

I am having a good time with my internship/job. I really like Mrs. Jacobs, she is a fan of big band music, kinda fun listening to it while filling orders and mixing paint. They are better songs to shake cans to but I make due with the old timey stuff. One day when I was filling cans I almost blacked out! The fumes must have really gotten to my head, I tumbled a bit and my eyes had tunnels at the end, but I blinked a few times and it went away! Weird huh?

It made me think about a time when we were younger, you and me we making a snack at my house, mac and cheese. I remember you spaced out for like a whole minute then you were all like 'wow my hands are so small!?' You remember? Ha, I laughed at that for a while when I remembered it. One of the songs made me think of that memory, the melody sorta washed it up on the shore for me to see. I remember after that I made you mac and cheese but that cant be right... My mom wouldn't let me use the stove, I was like six. But I do remember distinctly having mac and cheese. Maybe I broke the rules and didn't bother too remember, typical.

I hope you get to eat ... tbc]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doyle sat down heavily into the high bound leather chair across from Harry.Â  He took a deep draw off one of the two tumblers of brandy he was holding.Â  Harry ignored him and stared into the roaring fireplace nearby.

Doyle raised the other glass, his finger pointing at Harry.Â  He started to speak and then drained the tumbler, set it aside and pointed at Harry again.Â  He started to speak again, stopped, and drained the second tumbler.

"Are you 'rightfully, and royally drunk' enough yet?" Harry asked, still looking at the fire.

"I will God damn well tell you when God damn I am drunk enough," Doyle roared.Â  A few of the other members of the Club looked over, but not many.Â  Even the staff made no move to encourage proper decorum as they might with another gentleman.Â  Doyle shook his finger at Harry but seemed to be at a loss for words.

Harry ignored him and watched the flames.Â  On a small table between the two chairs was a folded newspaper inside of which was wrapped the German insignia.Â  At Madame Evrelsa's (or Velsa's as Harry was coming to think of her) no one--including Velsa--had wanted to touch it so the valets had used a newspaper to scoop it up.Â  Doyle had protested that even until Harry had pointed out that the valets' had used was the Sports page.Â  At the point, Doyle had grudgingly let Harry accept the wrapped up newspaper and stormed out into the alley.

Doyle reached over and grabbed Harry's untouched drink.Â  He downed it in a single swallow then slammed the tumbler down.Â  He glared at Harry, looking for some sort of response.

"Now?" Harry asked.

Enraged, Doyle cast his eyes about angrily for another tumbler.Â  Not finding one he picked up Harry's and slammed it down again.

"You are behaving like a child," Harry said finally turning to look at Doyle.

"You are God damned right!Â  I am scared off of my marbles," Doyle whispered fiercely.

"And I am not," replied Harry.Â  He turned back to the fire.Â  "The bttom of the lake.Â  What do you think it means, Doyle?"

Doyle shoved himself back into his chair.Â  He started to reach for the newspaper then froze, remembering what it held.Â  Â He quickly pulled his hand back.Â  After a moment, he patted angrily at his jacket pocket searching for a cigar.Â  Finally, he gave up and waved over one of the Club's staff, a tall, elderly man, for one and a set of matches.

"You are sure it is genuine?" Harry asked once the elderly man was gone.Â  Doyle looked down at the newspaper and then away quickly.

"Yes," he muttered.Â  "But they are easy to find.Â  We killed a hundred thousand of those bastards on the Western front."

"Bastards?" Harry raised an eyebrow.Â  "You believe it is his?Â  Your...adversary."

Doyle peeled back the newspaper slightly, looked inside then let it fall closed.Â  He shrugged and re-lit his cigar with fresh match.

"I hate the brand of these they keep here at this Club," he said loudly to no one in particular.Â  "Won't stay properly lit."

Harry reached down and picked up the insignia carefully.Â  He leaned over and held it in Doyle's face.Â  "Is it his?" he said, the words drawn out.

"Perhaps," Doyle said in the same evenly measured tone.Â  "It appeared, appeared, mind you, to come from the wall.Â  You of all people know it could be slight of hand."

"Yes.Â  But the scene that played out on the wall?" Harry asked.Â  "That was you, was it not?"

Doyle leaned back deeper into the chair.Â  "It was a moving picture.Â  Of two men dressed in uniforms and one died.Â  Appeared to die."Â  Doyle suddenly shot forward.Â  "These women are charlatans.Â  I have told that story a hundred times in bars on both sides of the Atlantic."

Harry raised an eyebrow.Â  "I have never heard you speak of it.Â  Why do I doubt anyone has heard it before?"

"Bess has," Doyle said coldly.Â  "Ask your wife the next time you see her."

Now it was Harry who bristled.Â  He slammed the insignia onto the small table and turned back toward the fire, his eyes hard.Â  Doyle regarded him angrily then deflated and sighed.Â  He signaled for another drink.

"I am sorry, Harry," he said, "that was petulant."

Doyle picked up the insignia and examined it closely.Â  "When I stayed with you during that bout of fever I must have raved it at some point, because late one evening she cornered me in the kitchen and demanded the story."Â  Doyle looked up from the insignia.

"Where was I?" Harry asked distantly.

"Asleep, I suppose.Â  She set a right proper ambush, too.Â  Came with a bottle of cognac and two glasses.Â  At first, I thought all of my dreams had come true and she had come to her senses."

Harry chuckled.Â  "You hold a special place in her heart."

"Damn all beautiful women who fall madly in love with a man's best friend," Doyle grumbled, but he was smiling.

"You should have--" Harry started.

"Skipped the horse races," Doyle finished with mock sourness.Â  It was an old joke.Â  After a moment, he crushed his cigar in the tray and sat forward.Â  He took Harry's hand gently.

"If you go down this path, Harry, you will lose her.Â  Leave this.Â  Go find her.Â  Start your life with Bess again.Â  Women are amazing creatures, they can forgive a man almost anything.Â  And then make him pay for the rest of his life."

Harry smiled then said seriously.Â  "I should.Â  I know it," he grabbed Doyle's hand and flipped it over with a flourish.Â  The German insignia was in it.Â  "But something came across, Doyle.Â  Maybe..."

"Maybe something can go back across," Doyle said, balling his hand into a fist, the insignia cutting painfully into his palm.Â  His mask was on but inside he was filled with silent, impotent rage.Â  He wanted to toss the insignia into the fire.Â  He wanted to someone to fight.Â  He wanted a corporeal opponent that he could swing against, to drive his fists into until his knuckles were bloody.Â  At the moment, Doyle would have given anything to be able to fight whatever was breaking the two people he loved most in this world.

But he was helpless.

Doyle forced himself to relax his fist.Â  Harry was nattering on, uncharacteristically obtuse to the struggle going on inside Doyle.

"We have to return to Madame Evrelsa," Harry was saying.Â  He rocked back and forth in his chair.Â  "Make her tell us more.Â  About, about everything."

Doyle ignored Harry's incessant monologue and closed his fist around the insignia again, though more gently this time.Â  He mimed punching his own chin.Â  "Bastard..." he whispered.]]></content:encoded>

Ellory stood next to the sign and pointed. Hard Rock Cafe the sign said, Ellory was beaming eyes wide open and goofy smile. Hey Ellory wanna get something to eat? Michael
Said from behind the camera. Uh yeah Ellory said twirling into crouched stance. Letâs get food... wait Ellory interrupted. Lemme see those pictures. Gotta be just right! Why Michael asked, his hunger making his tone short and snarky. Well thatâs a good question, but I know I want to a good picture, I donât know why all my pictures have to be good. After all arenât we supposed to capture bits of life with pics?  Not all of life is posed. Right Michael said letâs eat. Ahh tut ... lemme see just to make sure itâs at least not bad. Ellory zoomed in looking at her face, her legs, her hands. Ah letâs do one more but come closer and donât get so much space above my head, like hold the camera like this, ok!? Donât move. Ok now. Ellory kicked one leg back and pointed at the sign making much the same expression as before, a rehearsed spontaneous wide eye smile. Michael hit the shutter button with out moving from where Ellory positioned him. Ellory bounced over and studied the image again. Ok, I think we got it! Doesnât that feel good? You want one? No thanks Michael said I will take a picture in my head, he held up his thumb and index finger mimicking a camera and hit the imaginary shutter. Pshh brains donât keep it as good. Michaels stomach growled, the smell of fried food carried on the salty air. Michael said ok but you gotta be in it with me. He turned and held the camera up with on hand and pulled Ellory close. Their heads almost touching, Ellorys cheeks shown bright red interrupted by a soft but very real smile. </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[See this is why I think you might eventually have trouble with rom-com readers (Hey I've watched Nottinghill 47 times and some parts in slow motion!  I can talk about rom-comers).  There is an under current of attraction there.  Some of it I think is hormones.  At that age you can't feel a strong breeze without having to run for a cold shower.  That bit at the end though, it's subtle but the blushing keeps bringing me back to the question of "this is a lot of work to go through for friendship."  Maybe too much Nottinghill on my part but it seems that attraction love etc tie together some stories and motivate some characters.  But maybe the power of the piece will be in a friendship worth more than physical attraction and love.  Still I think the rom-comers will flip if he does all of this and there's no kiss/pay off at the end :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory stood on a stool while stirring a pot over the stove. Her mother never let her turn the stove on but ellory still liked cook the way here mother does. The red apron she wore came down to her shins. The backside of her dress was jumbled in the haphazard knot of the aprons belt. In he pot was a box worth of macaroni and cheese with the cheese powder floating on top of the murky water. She turned around and gave a toothy smile. Would you like some pasta de for Mage? She asked. He lied and said please. Hold on a sec she said as she jumped down from her stool and cleared off some mail and water based paint bottles. Sit she said shortly. He sat down and Ellory hopped back over to the counter and grabbed a grubby plastic bowl. It had recently had macaroni in it and a few noodles still stuck to the bottom of the bowl. A few seconds under the water and a blow to dry. Would you like a lot ? She asked. Again he said please. Maybe he would like it, he felt lots of things differently when he was younger. Maybe his taste used to center around uncooked noodles and cheesy water. Ellory scooped the pot up between her stomach and forearm and lent forward to poor a helping of her homemade meal. The pot tipped precariously and orange water sloshed over her fingers into the bowl. Here she said and set the bowl down hard, so much so some fell out on to the counter. Thank you he said and took up his spoon and filled it with the concoction. It tasted like water that had been used to clean the surface of a used pan. It was room temperature and had a decidedly metallic after taste. To his surprise ellory turned away from watching him eat to go back to her cooking. The edge of the bowl bent as he picked it up and lowered it down to Petes level. Here doggy he muttered. Pete looked up at him with a smug look. He knew better than to eat anything offered by Michael or anyone while ellory was around. He raised his white eyebrows and looked over towards the stove as Ellory sighed and started to turn round. Michael pulled the bowl back up from underneath the table knocking about and spilling bits as he went. He pulled back his lips and shown his teeth towards Ellory in the most disingenuous smile he had ever accidentally made. She marched over to the table and stood across from Michael. I like to watch my dinners being enjoyed she said. Something she heard from her mother. She leaned forward as she rested her face on her hands and planted her elbows on the table. Her brown hair was pressed tight on her scalp and he nose looked flushed as her cheeks rose higher being pushed by the weight of her head on her hands. Go on! Big spoonfuls are best. He tried to appear excited. His lower teeth peered through as he fought natural in in inclination. Yum he said after a big swallow of orange pasta water. He had almost reached the bottom when she said; boy all that eating has made me hungry. It is your turn to fix me something. He hadn't known they were taking turns. She popped up and grabbed the left over Mac from the stove and poured it into the sink. No good she said, you got the best part, what are you gonna make me?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the playfulness that comes out in Ellory mixed with seriousness of her accomplishment (or not accomplishment) of her cooking.  She is really fleshing out now for me.  It's funny but I had forgotten how awkward teenage years are.  That being so in your own head that you miss obvious cues from others combined with being so hyperfocused on others (and how they perceive you) that you can be wracked with anxiety.  Ellory wants to impress him and i think its funny she chose something she is so horribly bad at.  So the question is is this her first time cooking for non-family?  Or is this really her first try at cooking.  Or maybe her family just has horrible cooking skills and thus a very low culinary baseline.  I think some of the noodles he eats should be undercooked, some slimy, and some overcooked almost burned.  And Ellory should comment about that.  Maybe Mom always says....  And that can answer my question above about the cooking and also tell us something a bout her mother.  If mom always say Ellory, that girl is a source of a need to buy new pans. then we see that maybe her mom is a passable cook but feels Ellory is not.  And then--since we know she is a crappy cook--we get a view into her character.  Does she just not realize the sarcasm?  That speaks of being overly self absorbed.  Does she SECRETLY realize there is sarcasm and this is kind of a test to see whether she really is a good cook and her mom wrong.  That speaks so hiding your feelings about going out on the ice but still sticking a toe out so see if it is relatively safe.  Or maybe Ellory is the only one who cooks in her family which opens questions about why.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel squeaked slightly as he felt himself being pulled backwards.Â  He was falling then his back slammed into the wall and his head bounced against it next.Â  His glasses were knocked askew then he felt rather than saw a slim hand yank them off his nose.Â  A door slammed and the lights came on.

"Whaaaa---"

"Shut it, Danny boy."

"Michelle?" Daniel asked.Â  The figure in front of him was blurry but he thought he could make out enough of the features to see it was her.Â  "What are we doing?"

"We?" Michelle asked acidly.Â  "In your dreams, Virgin Sacrifice.Â  WE are doing nothing.Â  YOU are answering questions."

Daniel felt carefully around him.Â  "Are we in...are we in the janitor's closet?"

"No, this is where I bring all my conquests."

"Really?" Daniel asked.

"No!Â  None of your business, creep!" Michelle yelled.

"But you, me, you pulled me in here," Daniel protested.

"So you think I am slut, Danny Boy," Michelle said.Â  There was a dangerous undertone in her voice.

"Uh, no I meant, wait, what are you doing in here in the first place!"Â  Daniel demanded.

"Waiting for you to walk by."Â  Daniel heard Michelle pick up something and flip it over.Â  Her blurry form sat down.

"Take a seat, DB," she said.

"That acronym can be taken in a number of different ways," Daniel said,Â  but he slid down the wall into a sitting position.Â  "Can I have my glasses back?"

"No," Michelle said.Â  She seriously considered dropping them onto the ground and crushing them for half a minute.Â  Instead she put them into her jacket pocket.

Daniel tried to adjust his position and was jabbed in the ribs by something blunt.Â  He recoiled from it only to get poked in his arm hard by something else on the other side.

"Ow! Gees, it must be hard to have sex in here," he said, rubbing where he had been jabbed.

Michelle stared open mouthed then sighed dramatically.Â  "Teenage boys.Â  Don't you ever think about anything else?"

Daniel opened his mouth partially in shock at what she had said, partially what he had said, and partially because he suddenly was very aware that he was alone in a small, confined space with a girl.Â  A very mean, but also very female girl.

"So..." he said, then trailed off.Â  The silence hung between them for a few seconds.

"Why are you helping me?" Michelle blurted out.Â  "Why do you care?"

"Huh?" Daniel said.Â  He had been trying not to think about certain things and the sudden question caught him off guard.Â  "The Club.Â  The--I think it will be fun to try to figure out a real crime."Â  As soon as the words left his lips he knew it was a mistake.

<em>You can't un-ring a bell, chief.</em>Â  Daniel's grandfather always said that and the words flooded into his mind, choking off his attempt to take back his words.Â  "Ahhh...um..."Â  A sound like a thousand bees buzzing filled his ears.Â  He put his fingers in his ears trying to clear them.Â Â <em>Breathe, Daniel,</em> he thought.

"Fun."Â  Michelle muttered.Â  She scowled.Â  "Fun."Â  The dangerous undertone was back.Â  She leaned back and put a hand on the doorknob.Â  "Have a nice life, Danny Boy, you are free to go."Â  She started to twist the handle then stopped and looked up at it.Â  "That's weird," she said, right as the buzzing in his ears began to fade.

Because of the buzzing and since she was still blurry shapes and angles in the dark light Daniel missed her trying the door handle.Â  "It's not weird," he said, thinking she was still talking about his explanation.Â  "Okay, maybe a little."

"What?" Michelle said, looking back at him, slightly confused.Â  "You don't think it's weird?"

"Fine.Â  It's weird.Â  A lot weird, but..." Daniel trailed off for a second.Â  "It is actually the reason I joined the Club."

Michelle looked between Daniel and the door handle.Â  "You lost me.Â  I mean on a scale of 1 to Stupid that makes no sense."

Daniel took a deep breath and let it out heavily.Â  "Have you ever seen an angel?Â  A real one, not the carved ones on the church downtown."

Michelle watched him carefully.Â  She tried the door again and when it would not turn let her hand fall quietly onto the handle of a broom standing upright near her.

"We're passed Stupid and into Loco, Danny Boy," Michelle said.Â  "You are officially scaring me now.Â  And that says a lot since you apparently are blind as a bat and have those toothpick arms of yours."Â  She pointed up at the door handle with her free hand.Â  "Did you do this somehow when I pulled you in here?"

"Do what?Â  Wait did you say 'Toothpick arms'?"

"Well, they are--"

"Can you just shut your stupid, sexy lips for two minutes so I can explain?" Daniel yelled.

"Sexy?" Michelle said, raising an eyebrow.Â  "You think my lips are sexy?"

"What?Â  I never said that.Â  I said 'stupid lips.Â  Stupid.Â  Like your Stupid scale and this stupid closet"Â  Daniel climbed to his feet, knocking over some cleaning supplies.Â  He groped forward until his hand found the door handle.

"Don't bother, Danny Bo--"

Daniel twisted it and yanked the door open.Â  "Keep the glasses!Â  You probably broke them already anyways."

"Hey!" Michelle said, shooting to her feet.Â  "How did you--"

Daniel rounded on her.Â  "You want to know why I care?Â  Because, because I didn't once and Rodney did and something happened.Â  To him!Â  Rodney!Â  To him.Â  Because--as you so eloquently pointed out--I am a coward.Â  I did nothing.Â  Rodney?Â  He did and I think he was... I-, I-, I don't know what but he just was or maybe the kid was.Â  I don't know.Â  I just know this time I want it to be me.Â  To happen to me!"

Daniel stopped.Â  He was breathing hard.Â  He felt around in his jacket pocket for his inhaler.Â  "Aw heck!Â  I lost my inhaler in here somewhere and you won't give me my glasses and I can't--"Â  He threw his hands up in the air.

Michelle did not respond.Â  She was staring at the door handle.Â  She touched it tentatively.Â  It had been crushed into a tiny misshapen ball with faint lines that appeared to be finger width apart running across it.

"Far out," she said.

Daniel knelt down on the floor and began sweeping his hands around trying find a shape that felt like an inhaler.Â  He accidentally swept his hand into the brick wall and one of the bricks cracked.Â  "Oh that's just great.Â  Now I have to replace the drywall in here.Â  My dad is going to be ecstatic."

Michelle's eye tracked his movements.Â  They took in the wall, the crack and what was left of the door handle again.Â  Daniel swiped at something else and she instinctively took a step back.Â  "Calm down, Danny Boy," she said, her mind trying to make sense of what she was watching.Â  "You were telling me about angels.Â  You and Rodney saw them."

Daniel sat back on his haunches, frustrated.Â  "No, that's not what I said.Â  Stop trying to make me sound craz--ow!Â  Is everything in this stupid closet made of cheap plastic!!??"Â  Daniel had just accidentally thrust his hand through a metal bucket as he was gesturing in frustration.

"Danny--Dan--Daniel! Stop! Let me help you before you cut yourself," Michelle said.

"What?Â  Oh..." Daniel said, holding his hand up, seeing the bucket on it.

"Just breathe," she said, edging closer to him.

"I am--sorry," Daniel took a deep breath.Â  "I. Am. Trying. To breath.Â  I need my inhaler.Â  Which is on the floor somewhere apparently because it's not in my pocket."Â  He felt her fingertips touch his forearms lightly and he froze.Â  "What are you doing?"

"Letting you know where I am so that you don't knock me into the walls with all your flailing," Michelle said.Â  She watched him carefully as she moved closer.Â  She had no intention of removing the bucket only distracting Daniel long enough for her to slip by and open the door.Â  "So Rodney and you saw angels or something?"Â  A few steps more...

"No, more like he became one and I just watched it all happen," Daniel said tiredly.

The idea was so absurd that it stopped Michelle in her tracks.Â  "Rodney...became...an...angel?"

"I think so," Daniel said.Â  "Maybe."

"Rodney that goes to this school?Â  Rodney that is dumber than a dyslexic poodle?"

"Hey!" Daniel protested.Â  "He IS my best friend, you know."

Michelle held up her hands in a placating gesture.Â  "Sure.Â  Right.Â  Got it."Â  Two more steps.

"It was at theÂ State Fair.Â  When it was in Loganville a few years back.Â  Did you go to it?" Daniel had a strange note of hope in his voice.

Michelle stopped edging towards the door.Â  She remembered that Fair very well because she was not at it.Â  She had been caught sneaking back into her bedroom the weekend before and had been grounded.Â  She thought no one in the town had gone because it was so far away and so expensive to get there.

"No," she said.Â  "You and Rodney were there?"

"My dad took us," Daniel said.Â  "It was the year my mom died.Â  So he was trying to do a lot of stuff with me back then.Â  So he took me and Rodney over there."

Michelle had no idea that Daniel's mom was dead.Â  She only knew Daniel's father was the Sheriff because she had been picked up from the Sheriff's Station half-a-dozen times by her parents in the past few years.Â  She decided not to mention she was only now realizing Daniel's mom was dead.

"Was it fun?" she asked.Â  Michelle had always felt like that Fair would have been one of the most amazing experiences of her life.Â  She had refused to speak to her father for a month and had spoken, very loudly, to her stepmother for much longer than a month.Â  She spent most of that year livid and the one following.Â  Deep down she had always felt robbed for some reason.

"Yeah," Daniel said.Â  "Until John Suse died."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Suus?" Michelle asked.Â  She cocked her head to one side.Â  "Not a common name around here."

"I'm not making it up."Â  Daniel waved his bucket-encased hand at Michelle.Â  "I thought you were going to take this plastic bucket off my hand."

"Are you bleeding?" Michelle asked.

"Um, no.Â  I don't think so," Daniel said, feeling along his wrist where it plunged into the opening in the side of the pail.

"Too bad.Â  A little blood and it would slide right off those toothpick arms."

"Hey!" Daniel yelled.Â  He clutched the bucket to his chest and wrapped an arm protectively around it.Â  "It's fine.Â  Never mind."

Michelle smirked.Â  This kid had practically punched through a brick wall, had actually punched through a metal pail, and had apparently crushed a door handle into a small ball in his panic.Â  And here she was less than a foot away insulting him, but then that had always been her response to fear--make the bastard fear you and not the other way around.

"I can't take you seriously with that bucket on your hand."Â  Michelle's hands shot out and grabbed the edges of the bucket.Â  She gave the pail a vicious tug and Daniel's hand slid out of the hole in the pail with a slight pop.

Michelle set the pail down.Â  "Close your eyes."

"Why?" Daniel asked warily, rubbing his wrist.

"I am going to put your glasses back on you so you don't get excited and accidentally rupture my spleen with more flailing around."

Daniel started to protest then sighed and nodded.Â  He was tired and just wanted to get out of this closet and away from this crazy girl.Â  Or at least that is what he thought he wanted until he felt her breath on his face as she knelt in front of him to put his glasses back on.Â  She smelled like cinnamon.Â  When he opened his eyes he could see again.Â  Her face was inches from his and she was peering at him like he was some sort of experiment or weird bug she had captured under a microscope.Â  She stared at him for another few seconds then sat back.Â  "You were telling me about a kid, Danny Boy" she said.

"Right," Daniel said.Â  "The kid."Â  He took a breath.Â  "I was there and I still don't know if it is a true story.Â  Rodney doesn't remember it this way, so maybe I made it up.Â  And there is no proof, like, really none.Â  I tried to check back later, but there was nothing.Â  Not even an obituary.Â  So this all may be some crazy lie that I made up because I was bored."

"But you don't think so," Michelle said.

"No," Daniel said.Â  He rubbed the bridge of his nose.Â  "I do.Â  By the way, do you need to sit so close?Â  I'm kind of claustrophobic."

Michelle smirked and Daniel immediately blushed realizing how it sounded.

"Okay," Michelle said, sliding back a little.Â  "Is this far enough that my feminine wiles won't ensnare your feeble brain?"

<em>Don't look at her breast!</em> Daniel chided himself.Â  <em>More than once,</em> he amended.Â  "Yes, that's far enough," Daniel said.

"So, my dad and his deputies do side work sometimes across the state line.Â  Mostly just county fairs.Â  Never anything big.Â  Dad says that the State cops take all the high paying side jobs, but a lot of people know him on that side of the line from when he was in the Four State Championship game in high school so he and his get a nod towards some of the medium level paying stuff."

Daniel did not have to sayÂ <em>whichÂ </em>sport his dad played or when he was in high school.Â  There had only ever been one "Dream Team" in the area ever and his dad had been captain of the basketball team that had taken the town "all the way across the Line".Â  Over the years a few Cruggwater Cretin teams had won the County Championship and one team about 12 years back had won tri-Country, but none within a 300 miles of Cruggwater had even come close to repeating that golden season.Â  No one even bothered to run against Sam Stowwater in the elections for sheriff anymore.

"My dad used to take me, and sometimes me and Rodney, with him.Â  Usually to the small county things because..." Daniel sighed, "even 25 years on people hold grudges or want to see if Dad 'still has it'.Â  At small county fairs everyone knows who is trouble and the local cops head it off before it gets out of hand.Â  But at bigger stuff like this my dad says you never know who is trouble until its too late to do anything but deal with them on their terms."

"I was supposed to be there, you know," Michelle said.

"Your parents could afford to take you through the front gate," Daniel said, smiling.Â  "So why--"

"John Suus," Michelle prompted.

"Yeah.Â  So, people always challenge Dad to stupid stuff like free throw contests or pick up games.Â  Dad doesn't play the games since his knees hurt now and no one usually will go up against him on free throws since he has cleaned out so many people now that now one is will to throw away good money."

"You dad never misses a shot, right?" Michelle asked.

Daniel nodded.Â  "Free throw.Â  He never missed a free throw.Â  He's okay to average (his words, not mine) on any other shot."

"That's why he was across to the other side the park when it happened," Daniel continued.Â  "You probably heard the story same as anyone else.Â  It was a freak thing.Â  They were changing the riders over when one car on the Positron broke loose and slid off.Â  It went past a hundred people--including me and Rodney.Â  Just swept by like a train before anyone knew what was happening.Â  Maybe that's what saved us all, no one had time to do something stupid like run and accidentally knock someone else into the car's path."

"Except John Suus," Michelle said.

"Except him," Daniel agreed.

"Except one kid who no one else remembers dying except you," Michelle added.

"I'm not making it up," Daniel said harshly.Â  "I know what I saw."

Michelle held up a hand.Â  "I didn't say I don't believe you."

Daniel scowled then shrugged.Â  "So the Positron car travels through a hundred people and no one gets a scratch.Â  People are all shocked and then every emotion is on display somewhere.Â  People laughing, people crying, somebody even was kissing.Â  Rodney and I laughed.Â  We were at the front of the spot where the car hit.Â  Rodney was sort of an accidental hero.Â  He stumbled and kicked some big rock and stubbed his toe, but it moved the rock just enough that when the car hit it it got deflected into the booth beside us and ricocheted down the line like a pinball, hitting and bouncing between building after building but never hitting one person."

"We were laughing and walking away when I, I guess heard something.Â  Not really heard, but felt a scream."

"You felt a scream," Michelle said incredulously.

"That's the only way I can describe it," Daniel said.Â  "And it was only me because I spun around andÂ  looked and there was a kid about my age pounding on the Positron.Â  Nobody was paying much attention to him at first and then I started running toward the Positron and Rodney too.Â  'What are we doing?' I asked Rodney.Â  'Some kid is under that car,' he yelled.Â  'Where did he come from?'."

We got there and the kid--the one pounding the car, not the one under it--started trying to move it.Â  Rodney for once beat me to the punch and figured out what was going on and that there was someone under the car."

"Did Hell freeze over that day, too?" Michelle asked.

"Rodney has his moments," Daniel said defensively.Â  "Not many," he conceded after a second.

"Rodney yells 'Help me!' and we start trying to move that car.Â  Eventually some adults help us and the kid who keeps yelling 'John!' over and over again and we shift the car up and see what's underneath.Â  And then we all dropped it fast and backed away."

"What is gross?" Michelle asked.Â  She was twirling a finger through her hair nonchalantly but there was a tension in her tone.

Daniel nodded.Â  "Extremely.Â  The kid after seeing what's left of his friend under that car really starts to lose it.Â  He falls onto the ground and grabs at me trying to pull me down with him.Â  I flinch back but he still gets me and it's like iron on my leg.Â  Now I'm screaming and Rodney is yelling at the kid to calm down and trying to get the kid to tell him what happened."

"By then someone had gotten the police there and my dad was one of them.Â  People were starting to freak out because the ones that saw the body were telling other people and fights were breaking out.Â  Some people said they wanted to see if the kid was still alive, but I think maybe they just wanted to see the body.Â  It turned into chaos and police got wrapped up in that.Â  My dad looks at me over the crowd and gestures for me and Rodney to come and help him with the car so that he can get the body out."

"Rodney took off immediately towards my dad.Â  I couldn't move because the kid was holding me but my dad couldn't see the kid over all of the people between us.Â  My dad is screaming and waving me over and I am yelling back and trying to point at the ground."Â  Daniel paused.Â  "Then I saw it in his face.Â  'Coward', he was thinking.Â  He looked at Rodney running toward him and then back at me and then just turned away like he couldn't see me."

"That's harsh," Michelle said softly.Â  "What did he say when you told him afterwards?Â  Did Rodney..." she stopped.Â  "Rodney didn't remember it the same way you did?"

"He doesn't remember the kid," Daniel said bitterly.Â  It had been hotly debated by Daniel and Rodney later and neither had agreed with the other.Â  Rodney had been dead sure that there was no friend of the dead kid.Â  Daniel desperately needed there to have been to save face with his father.

Michelle waited.

Finally, Daniel said, "The sky was purple.Â  It was the middle of the day but I swear it was purple like a bruise.Â  The kid let me go after that and then started crying and said he had to get away from everything.Â  So I put my arm around him and shuffled him up to a hill that's near there.Â  The kid was blubbering on about his friend, John, and how John's brother had died recently and that this was going to kill John's mother."

"I could see Rodney and my dad down there helping people and dealing with the Positron car."

"Rodney?" Michelle said.

"Yep," Daniel said and smiled wanly.Â  "It was--well, my dad anyways said it was Rodney's finest hour."

<em>Bet that hurt,Â </em>Michelle thought.

"Eventually one of the State cops came over and collected a statement from the kid and from me.Â  Got our name and addresses and told us not to leave the park.Â  As soon at the State leaves the kid has to go and find his other friend that is there and tell him John Suus is dead.Â  So I try to wave at my dad but he doesn't see me so I just go with the kid because I can't leave him alone like this.Â  We wandered for what must have been an hour or so until we finally find another kid that the friend of John recognizes. 'You have to tell him about John', he says, 'I can't!Â  I can't do it.'"

"So I go up to this other kid and on the way up there I am figuring out what to say."Â  Daniel was silent for a minute or two.

"And," Michelle prompted.

"And I screwed that one up, too.Â  First words out of my mouth: John Suus is dead, man.Â  Well, this guy is big and he wants to fight me until I point over my shoulder at John Suus' friend, the kid with the kung-fu iron grip.Â  And the big guy just knew.Â  I could see it in his face, like the whole world drained out of him.Â  He came and fetched his friend and two of them started screaming 'John Suus', over and over again and yelling up into the sky."

"What did you do then?" Michelle said.

Daniel shrugged.Â  He looked down.Â  "What could I do?Â  I left.Â  They had each other.Â  I went back but everything was wrapping up.Â  They even had that stupid Positron car on a flat bed and were towing it away.Â  A blanket over the body. I walk up to my dad.Â  I tried to tell him what happened but he doesn't even look at me.Â  Just tells me to go to the car until he and Rodney--Rodney!!--are done."

Daniel leaned back and sighed.Â  "I tried to find that kid later.Â  Tried everything I could think of.Â  Asked my dad to get the police report where I had been interviewed with that kid so that I could get his address or at least his name.Â  But there was no report filed.Â  When my dad asked him the State cop said he didn't know anything about two kids on a hill.Â  I checked newspaper articles here and even once snuck out of school and took a bus over to their grave yard to see if I could find John Suus's grave."

"Nothing," Michelle said.

Daniel laughed bitterly.Â  "Nothing."

"But you still believe it?" she asked.Â  "That is happened the way you said?"

"Yep," Daniel said and there was steel in his eyes.Â  "I do."

"So you want to help now with the murder because you didn't help then? You felt like Rodney stepped up and you didn't."

Daniel nodded vigorously.Â  "People said Rodney was like an angel.Â  He was everywhere all at once.Â  Had the answers--this WAS reported in their papers over there by the by: Boy Genius Saved Hundreds.Â  But I know Rodney--he could never do something like that.Â  I think he was possessed by angel."

"You know that possession is demons, right?Â  Not angels," Michelle replied.

"Then Rodney asked it in or something.Â  I don't know, but something happened that day and I wanted it to be me this time.Â  I want to be the guy people say is a 'Boy Genius'."

<em>Especially if one of those people is your dad,</em> Michelle thought.

"Okay," she said, standing.Â  "Good enough."

Daniel looked confused.Â  "Wha--okay.Â  So I'm good?Â  To help find the killer?"

Michelle shrugged.Â  "It sounds like it's more about you and Daddy time, but if it solves the case then I don't care."

Daniel started to protest but Michelle waved it off and pulled on the door until it opened.Â  She started to step out then stopped and turned back.

"That kid was there, Daniel."

"How, how do you know that, Michelle?"

Michelle bit her bottom lip like she was carefully choosing her words.Â  "You said your dad didn't see you on the hill?"

"He didn't see me but it was a bit of a hike from the place where the car hit John Suus," Daniel said.

"And you didn't tell your dad about the hill?"Â  Michelle asked.Â  Daniel shook his head.Â  "Then how," Michelle continued, "would the State cop know that there WEREN'T two kids on a hill.Â  Why did the hill even come up?"

Daniel opened his mouth then closed it again then opened it.Â  Michelle winked at him.Â  "Think about it, Danny Boy."Â  And then she was gone.

&nbsp;

Michelle waved to Rodney.Â  It was about an hour after she had kidnapped Daniel.Â  Rodney was standing next to his locker.Â  He checked around him to see who she was waving at then realizing there was no one else there gave a tentative wave back.Â  She smiled brightly and walked up to him and then kneed him hard in the groin.Â  He dropped to his knees and whimpered.

Michelle put a finger under his chin and lifted his face up towards her.Â  "There were two kids on that hill," she said and walked off down the hall.Â  "Try to remember that," she called over her shoulder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rodney watched basketball practice through the narrow openings in between the bleacher seats. He squinted to see the clock, practice should have been over twenty minutes ago. The team was running sprints until the coach "got tired", TJ upset coach Alders by passing him the ball too hard. TJ was running hard and short of breath. Coach Alders yawned and stretched arms over his head leaning back in his desk chair. He belched and took a sip of his large soda mug while looking at his watch. "Ok, I am tired " he blubbered. "Wilson grab the cones, Mikey go get coaches bag and remember I need your report cards signed before next Thursdays game." Coach rolled out of his chair wheezing as he grabbed the bag from Mikey fumbling through the satchel of soda cans and dip looking for a his Red Indian can of snuff. "What an athlete" Rodney thought watching the former high school all star chug his soda, bits of syrupy liquid and sweat running down his enormous face. TJ was waiting in line for the water fountain his legs crossed and shoulders slumped watching the bulbous man shove a fistful of snuff in his pink face. Coach Russ Alders lumbered out of the gym followed by his son, a three fourths scale clone, who was still winded from watching the sprints. As soon the coach got out the door Mikey walked over and placed a hand on TJ's shoulder and looked at him earnestly and said "Hey TJ, you suck and I hate you."Â  TJ shrugged and sighed " Ok Mikey, good job out there today."Â  TJ had enough trouble for one day, he didn't want Mikey telling the whole school how he got mad at an autistic kid.Â  Mikey nodded and said "I know I did good, I would teach you how to do good like me if I liked you. But I don't" Mikey patted TJ on the shoulder again and then left. Wilson, a gangly ginger kid jumped in front of TJ and slurped up a mouthful of water then cupped his hand and flung water at TJ. TJ looked at the thin frail looking kid half his size. "You don't scare me ya big dope!" Wilson turned filled up another handful and lobbed it on TJ's shorts. "Ha looks like you pissed yourself ... again! " The scrawny kid looked to his right and his left looking for some one to share the laugh with, not realizing it was just him, TJ and a hidden Rodney hoping for a smackdown. TJ started breathing heavily through his nose and narrowed his eyes towards Wilson. Wilson suddenly aware of his size or lack of, turned to go.

Rodney sensing his chance started to climb out from under the bleachers, really hoping he could be quiet until he squeezed out from in between the seats. He wanted a mysterious aesthetic, a sudden and sly appearance. He pulled and wiggled his hips rapidly and stiffed his breathing. TJ leaned down to drink from the fountain. Rodney squirmed and pulled his legs free from the bleachers and pulled on his dark sunglasses. TJ turned and picked up a basketball, visibly angry he slung the ball with one arm from one side of the court to the other. "AHHHHHH" TJ yelled and clenched his fist. Whoosh the ball slipped through the net on the other side of the court. TJ was too upset to notice, "Nice shot" Rodney said leaning against a column a few rows up on the bleachers. "Whatever, what do you want Rodney? Have you been hiding under the bleachers smelling the seats again?" TJ rolled his shoulders trying to relax while he spoke. "I am here on official investigation business. And no I came in from " Rodney paused for a second considering his story "The window." "Investigation business? About Sarah? Why are YOU investigating. You should be investigated for skulking around." TJ walked over to the bench to grab his sweatshirt. "Well let's just say someone asked me to look into and I am getting all the facts." Rodney stepped down two rows of bleachers closing in on TJ. "Was it Dan's Dad? It was wasn't it. I already talked to him. Why did he ask you to talk to me?" Rodney didn't know the police had talked to TJ. He thought he was the only one with the sense to be suspicious of the hot headed Ex. "No it was someone close to Sarah. Someone who know's I am a guy who can get answers." Rodney said channeling his bravado. "Except in any and every class" TJ retorted then laughed looking to his left and right then stopped his laugh short when he realized no one heard him say something funny. Damn TJ thought that's the best comeback I have ever had and I wasted it on Rodney in an empty Gym. Rodney jumped down off the bleachers and took off his sunglasses in one quick motion. "Where were you the Saturday Sarah went missing? " TJ shrugged shaking his head, "You are pathetic. I was at home all day." Rodney pointed his finger and demanded "Who saw you there?" "It was just me. Home all day." TJ snapped back. "Can you prove it?" Rodney shot back. "Uh.. you can feel my tv, it's still warm." TJ Grabbed his gym back and flung it over his shoulder as he walked towards the door. Rodney called after him "Listen TJ, you better find a way to prove something, cause half the school has seen you flipping desks and knocking holes in the walls. The other half has heard all about it. You are famous for, and I don't mean to offend, being an angry idiot. You knocked a ref out in middle school. And your Ex girlfriend is missing. You better have something, cause I have heard lots of talk. And I only started some of it."Â  TJ turned, dropped his bag and charged towards Rodney. "You don't think I know all of that! Of course I know that." TJ grabbed Rodney's collar. " I am looking for Sarah and trying to figure out where she is so people will stop looking at me funny. It makes me want to hit em." Rodney gulped " Well don't hit em." Rodney stepped back releasing himself from TJ's grasp. "Maybe we could help each other. If you will be honest with me, and assure me you didn't put Sarah through a wall you can come with us. We are investigating anyway, you could ya know tag along." TJ starred at Rodney intently, then walked towards his bag picked it up and turned off the gym lights leaving Rodney in the dark. Rodney pulled out a lighter, realizing for the first time there weren't any windows in the gym.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harry looked up and down the alley quickly then turned back to the door and his lock picks.Â  They had started out early the next morning only to find the doors of the bar and also the one in the alleyway locked.Â  Doyle had been less than cordial when Harry had interrupted his morning tea to start the adventure but the magician had been undeterred.

"Why are we breaking in again?" Doyle asked.Â  He was watching one end of the alleyway while his valet watched the other.

"I want to get a look at that room again without Madame Evrelsa or her people around," Harry said.Â  He placed a pick back into his bag and pulled out a smaller one and began edging it into the door's lock.Â  "I do not know how much--"

"If anything," Doyle interrupted.

"If anything," Harry amended.Â  "If any of it was real.Â  You cannot trust a criminal mind to deal from the top, Doyle.Â  So I want look at that deck before deals any more cards from it."

"You think her tarot deck is a fake?"Â  Doyle brushed some snow off of a garbage can and sat on it.

"I am using the cards as a metaphor.Â  But you are correct that we should examine that as well."Â  Harry pulled out the pick and examined it.Â  He touched the flat of it to his tongue.Â  When Doyle raised an eyebrow he murmured, "Tasting for iron shavings.Â  To know where the tumblers are hitting."Â  He stared at the pick for a moment then put it back in the bag.Â  He looked at Doyle.Â  "This is wrong."

"Yes!" Doyle said, standing.Â  "Let us get breakfast and come back when they are--"

"This, however, is right," Harry said, holding up a different pick.

Doyle thumped down heavily on the garbage can again.Â  He looked around self-consciously then pulled out the half burned stub of a cigar and lit it.Â  "You abhor thievery, Harry."

"Yes," Harry said.Â  "Except in politicians and prostitutes.Â  There it is more akin to watching artists at work.Â  This is not thievery, Doyle, this is science.Â  Nothing done in the pursuit of science can be truly criminal."

Doyle's valet reached over and pointed at one of the picks.Â  Harry considered it then shook his head and went back to working the lock with his current one.Â  Doyle gave them both a dark look.

"You," he said, gesturing at Harry with his cigar, "are a fool."Â  He pointed at his valet.Â  "And what are you doing over here.Â  Go back to watch the other end of the alley."

"'s cold over there," the valet muttered as he trudged off.

"It's winter, you baboon get!" Doyle hissed after him.Â  "It is cold everywhere."

The valet made gesture over his shoulder that could be taken as either agreement or something less flattering.Â  Harry furtively looked up and then swapped out the pick he had been using for the one the valet had suggested.

"They know we are coming back, Doyle," Harry said, answering Doyle's unspoken question.Â  "But they are wrong about 'when' we are coming back."

The lock clicked and Harry stood up, smiling.Â  Doyle waved off his valet and stood up.Â  "Why do they know we are coming back?"

Harry held up the pick so that Doyle's valet could see it.Â  The valet nodded sheepishly then shrugged and walked off towards the car.

"What?" Harry said, packing up his things and listening at the door. "Oh, last night, I left your billfold behind so they naturally will assume you will want it back and come for it."Â  He smiled.Â  "During normal operating hours."

Doyle patted his jacket pockets suddenly then opened his mouth to yell.Â  Harry held up a hand to forestall his outburst.Â  "Politicians, prostitutes and magicians, I suppose."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harry opened the door and bowed with a flourish, gesturing for Doyle to step inside.Â  "Adventure awaits the bold."

Doyle harrumphed again and stepped inside.

"Bloody Hell," he muttered.

Harry stepped after him and stopped in the doorway.Â  "Oh," he said.

Inside Velsa stood with the rest of her valets.Â  All were carrying various blunt instruments, a few held wicked looking daggers.Â  "Is that a mace?" Harry whispered to Doyle.

"Morning star," said one of the valets.

"Gentlemen, so good of you to join us," Velsa said.Â  "Please ask your valet to come in out of the cold."

Doyle poked his head out of the door and signaled to Dobbs.Â  A moment later, Dobbs crept in carefully then stopped short.Â  "Right," he said then stood up.Â  "Is that a--?"

"Morning star," Harry confirmed.Â  "Yes, it is."Â  Dobbs gave Harry an appraising look and nodded approvingly.

"I left my wallet here last night, Madame," Doyle began.

"And you were worried that a charlatan with no scruples like myself would pilfer it so you decided to come early, break in, search through my establishment until you found it and anything else of interest to you," Velsa said.

Doyle pursed his lips and shot a look at Harry.Â  "I suppose is a fairly weak excuse when you put it that way, isn't it, Harry."

Velsa tossed the lead pipe she was holding onto one of the couches.Â  "Please leave your valet and follow me."

Dobbs looked at the valets and smiled widely.

"Care to say anything menacing as I go to guarantee my safety?" Doyle grumbled as he and Harry followed Velsa.

"Right," Dobbs said, "Mr. Doyle's, um, , a, ah--"

"Never mind," Doyle muttered and left the room.

Dobbs turned back to Velsa's valets.Â  "You ladies play dice?" he asked conspiratorially.Â  Five hands shot forward, each with a set of dice in their palm.

"Right..." Dobbs said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Velsa led Harry and Doyle to a room they had not been in before.Â  If appeared to be a storage room for props for the seances.Â  Exotic costumes, crystal balls and candles were everywhere.Â  Harry picked up a thick bound tome.Â  He peered at it queerly and tossed it from hand to hand a few times.

"Hollow?" he asked Velsa.Â  She nodded.

She sat down at a large table--most likely a spare for the table in the main room--and pulled the out from beneath it.Â  She placed it on the table and gestured for them to sit.

Harry took a seat and nodded to the camera.Â  "May I?"Â  Velsa nodded and he slid it in front of he and Doyle.

"You will find nothing inside that is different from any other camera of similar design," Velsa said.Â  "In truth, my family and I do not know why it works, only that it does."

"Magic?" Harry asked sarcastically.

Doyle opened the camera with a practiced ease.Â  He examined the inside carefully and prodded a few components.Â  He closed it and pushed it back to Velsa.

The three sat in silence for a moment, watching the camera.

"I want to use it again," said Harry.Â  "What else can it show us?"

"Normally, just a soul," said Velsa.

"A soul?!" exclaimed Doyle.

Velsa leaned forward.Â  "Yes, lost soldier.Â  What you saw was also new to me.Â  In the past, it was only a person's soul, never an event in time."

"Why a soul?" asked Harry.Â  "What use is that?"

"Do you believe in Heaven, Magician?"

"In theory," replied Harry, sitting back and crossing his arms.

"In practice," Doyle corrected with a stern look.Â  "You believe in practice, Harry."

"Quite so," Harry agreed, but looked less than convinced.

"People come to us sometimes with pictures of their dead loved ones.Â  They want to know if their soul was pure enough to enter Heaven or advance on the Great Wheel and so on."Â  Velsa retrieved a photograph from her pocket.

"May I see that?" Harry asked.

Velsa shoved it into a slot in the camera.Â  "The time for healthy skepticism is during my working hours, Mr. Houdini."Â  She faced the camera lens at a sheet hanging from a nearby wall and turned it on.Â  A slightly blurry figure appeared on the wall.Â  It was possible to make out that the figure facing the camera was in uniform: a soldier or possibly a policeman or fireman.

"This was left behind by one of my clients.Â  It is her son who died in the war."Â  Velsa adjusted the focus until his face was clear.Â  It was young soldier in his late teens or very early twenties.

Doyle stood up and walked over to the sheet.Â Â "Enlisted.Â  American," he said.

"Yes," Velsa said.Â  She twisted a knob on the camera.Â  The image wavered then became just a thin black silhouette of the soldier filled with white and dark patches.

"His...'soul'?" Harry asked.

"That or perhaps his ledger would be more accurate," Velsa responded.

"What are these spots?" Doyle asked indicating the dark patches in the silhouette.

"Stains or maybe holes." Velsa leaned back in her chair.Â  She retrieved a cigarette and placed it in a long holder.

"What is that?"Â  Doyle asked pointing to a wide slash running across one side of the soldier's silhouetted chest.Â  "Is there a...is that a face?"

"A face, yes," Velsa said quietly.Â  "It is someone he killed."

"Killed?" said Doyle, dubiously.Â  "Soldiers kill each other all of the time.Â  Even as fresh-faced as he is he would have had more than one killed if he was at the Front for longer than a few weeks."

"Those are the stains or holes on what would be his right side," Velsa said. "We carry the world on our right, our family is closer to the left.Â  Near our heart."

Doyle traced his hand over maybe twenty or thirty spots.Â  "Active little bugger.Â  How long was he at the Front?"

Velsa shrugged.

Harry pointed to the swash of dark on the soldier's left.Â  "Who is the face?Â  On his left."

Velsa shrugged again and took a long drag on her cigarette.Â  "I do not know.Â  But his mother did.Â  She left quickly after."

"Leaving behind one of the few pictures she had of her son?" Harry said skeptically.

"That is the face of a grown man," Doyle said, pointing at the small image on the soldier's left side.Â  "Can you shift it back to the photograph?"

Velsa turned the knob taking it from a silhouette to a photograph again.Â  She turned to Harry.Â  "She left here and was hit by a moving automobile a few blocks away."

"By accident?" Harry asked, horrified.

Velsa cocked her head and stared at Harry.Â  "That is a peculiar question, Magician."

Doyle was studying the projected photograph.Â  "Sniper or sharp shooter insignia.Â  Hmmm, he would have been kept too far from the lines to get that broken nose and broke jaw in hand-to-hand engagements."

He turned back to Velsa.Â  "That face.Â  The man's face in his silhouette.Â  It looked similar to his features."

"I thought the same," said Velsa.

"Of course you did," said Harry.Â  "So he killed his father because he beat him as a youth.Â  Then became a soldier and killed 20 or 30 men before dying.Â  Are you sure you are not reading a story into a photograph, Doyle?"

Doyle sat back down.Â  "I have seen more than a few healed jaws and reset noses in my time, Harry."

"I want a completely fresh experiment.Â  Doyle, let us have your picture taken and analyzed.Â  Then we will know whether this camera is real or a fraud."

"Are you daft, man!?" Doyle roared.Â  "Why my soul?Â  Why not yours?"

"Well, it cannot be Velsa.Â  She is an admitted charlatan."

"That is true," Velsa said.

"And," Harry continued, "I was not in the War so I will not have the kill marks like you would."

Doyle sat stunned for a moment.Â  "Kill marks," he said slowly.Â  "You say that with a significantly cavalier tone, Harry."

Harry leaned forward and put a hand on Doyle's arm.Â  "Arthur, you know I do not.Â  Please."

Doyle scowled but did not brush off Harry's hand.Â  "You understand what you are asking?Â  For me to literally bare my soul to you."

"If this thing even works," Harry said quickly.Â  Doyle stared at his friend for a long time.Â  Finally, he sighed and stood up.

"How do we do this?" he said to Velsa.

Velsa smiled coyly.Â  "A view to the soul of Arthur Doyle.Â  How delicious.Â  How very, very delicious this day has begun."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This isnât good. Not at all what Michael intended and he wasnât sure how to recover. Bailey panted in the front seat next to Michael, her nose smudged into the narrow opening of the window. The salty air made Bailey sneeze, Michael smiled at the exhausted but still very excited pooch. Bailey had been made to ride in the back on the way to the beach next to the chairs, buckets and umbrella but she had been promoted to the front seat. Hey your such a good girl Michael said scratching Baileys ears. Ellory starred out the window with her chin in her hand. Want to stop and get something to eat? Michael said. No thank you, Ellory said from the back seat. Ellory shook her head at her on reflection in the car window. Ellory's nose was bright red she scratched it softly feeling the burned skin. She paused her scratching as Michael looked back in the rear view mirror and pretended to be in a thoughtful pose. At a stop light two girls in bikinis walked by waving at Bailey in the front seat of the car. Their thin bodies looked like the cheerleader car wash type. Ellory turned her eyes towards Michael who had was looking intently at the display of inflatable boats and flag towels. She turned to see the pair adjusting their thin tops before walking onto the beach. A gaggle of bikers rumbled up besides the jeep, their zinc plated bikes rumbling the windows and causing Bailey to stand on all fours and pace excitedly. Ellory looked at large woman on the back of on of the rumbling bikes with a bulbous boil sitting to one side of her nose, her leather jacket was embroidered with the name "Big Crib" on the back. Crib waved with two hot dog tanned fingers. Ellory smiled timidly.

Michael remembered this day as he had spent it before, he had Seth and Clay ride up with him to the beach and they met Caitlin and Bethany. Caitlin had borrowed two bottles of rum from her parents and the group had shots and mixed drinks with sunny D from the gas station. They toasted Clay and Bethany for admission into state, Bethany was feeling victorious and playful. Michael's remembrance was interrupted by Baileys tail wacking him repeatedly as the bikers sparked forward blasting thunderous sound. Actually I think I do want to eat somewhere, Ellory said looking out on the pier taking in the sights of a busy fish fry food truck. Looks good to me Michael said as the light turned green. Ellory didn't sound playful but their was effort to avoid sounding sad and Michael was grateful for that. "Smells yummy!" Michael said stepping out onto the sidewalk to pump quarters into a hungry meter. Michael walked to the side door to help Ellory out. "You know I like little dives like this, super sterile and clean restaurants don't taste as good, know what I mean?" Michael said offering a hand to Ellory who was climbing over a beach chair. Ellorys fingers brushed the back of Michael's hand as she hopped down. "Yeah it's good for now." Ellory retorted marching towards the fair of fried food and colorful trucks and shops on the pier.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Click...click...spin...pull</em>

<em><span style="text-align: left; color: #333333; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; white-space: normal; cursor: text; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: transparent;">Click...click...spin...</span></em>

Harry pulled open the padlock and set it down in front of him.Â  There were 27 opened padlocks on the table.Â  Harry picked up one at random, closed it and inserted a tiny lockpick into the key hole.

<i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>

Harry tossed the opened lock down and grabbed another one.Â  It had taken him 4 seconds to open the last lock.Â  He stared off into the distance as he worked, his eyes unfocused.Â  The new lock, now closed, made a crunching sound when he twisted his pick.Â  Harry looked down at the lock curiously then extracted his pick and examined it closely.Â  It was broken.Â  He started at it for almost a full minute mapping out where the pick would have broken off and which tumblers could potentially be jammed inside the lock.

His gaze drifted over to the giant diving bell where he performed his underwater escape trick while confined by a straight jacket and locked chains.Â  He stood up and slowly walked its circumference as he used the broken pick to try to work the now jammed lock.

After some delicate, half noticed coaxing the jammed lock opened.Â  The broken part of the pick was still wedged inside, but Harry had still been able to work the tumblers.Â  He returned to the table of locks and shoved them into a velvet bag.Â  He peered at the jammed lock still in his hand then chucked it into the bag as well.Â  He immediately closed the bag and shook it, shuffling the contents.

Harry looked around guiltily though there was no one else in his studio.Â  "It opened once and it can be opened again," he said. Â  He waited, eyes searching the room.

"There are 26 fully functioning locks in that bag," he said, slightly defensive.Â  "26.Â  And I opened that one, too.Â  You saw it."

He sat down heavily in his chair.Â  "I am talking to an empty room.Â  Now, I am talking to myself in an empty room.Â  Brilliant.Â  Famed magician found stark raving mad in his home.Â  Babbling on about a padlock.Â  Full story in the evening edition."

Harry pulled out a fresh lockpick from the lining of his sleeve.Â  He opened the bag, selected a lock at random, and drew it out of the bag.Â  "If you were real," he said to the room, "if you were real..."Â  He closed the lock, inserted the pick into the keyhole and began working the tumblers.Â  He cleared his throat.Â  "You would be ashamed of me right now.Â  I have made a cock up of everything.Â  All of it.Â  Though I should not say that word to you." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>Â  The lock opened.Â  He tossed it on the table and pulled another lock out and started on it.Â  "Would not say that, I mean." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>

The lock opened and he placed it down and selected a new one.Â  It rote to him now after so many years.

<i>Click...click...spin...pull.</i>Â  Harry swapped out the lock he was holding for a new one.

"Do you know the first time I ever picked a lock was when I was just a boy?" <i>Click...click...spin...pull.Â  </i>Next lock.Â  "My mother had a candy jar that she kept in a locked cabinet.Â  I loved sweets back then."Â  <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>.Â  "For no reason other than maybe pure stubbornness, I would try to get those doors open and into that jar." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>.Â  "Then one day I realized I needed a key." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>Â  "The next day I realized I could make one with a few of the supplies in my toy box." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>.Â  "It was so...gratifying.Â  As if I had stolen the Fleece myself." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>.Â  Harry laughed.

His voice sobered.Â  "Then my mother, your grandmother, found out.Â  Still not sure how." <i>Click...click...spin...pull</i>.Â  "It was an unpleasant experience." <i>Click...click...Â </i>The lock in Harry's hands refused to open.Â  He pulled out his pick an peered at the lock's keyhole.Â  He tapped it once, listening, then stood up.Â  He opened the window and tossed it out.

Harry started back towards his chair then spun around and crept up to the window.Â  He leaned out and looked down then ducked back inside and crouched down.Â  He shoved the pick back up his sleeve and shot another glance over the window ledge and down into the street below.

He closed the window and walked over to the door, grabbing his jacket from the coat rack.Â  "Barking mad," he said, opening the door.Â  "I will most assuredly make the morning edition."Â  Harry sighed and walked out, closing the door behind him.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love this imagery. It takes me to Harry's inner thoughts without you directly saying Harry thought this. His fixating on the locks gives some background into his personality as well. We his someone who gets hooked on things and doesn't let go. We see his frustration with himself, he gets upset with himself for talking out loud, his emotional fixation is at war with his practical and pragmatic side. The reference to how he "Made of cock up of everything" Is this in reference to his relationship to his wife? If so does he blame himself? I have gotten the impression he holds a few things against his wife for discouraging his pursuit of his Daughter. Maybe he is back and forth on that. I would love to see Doyle doing something like this scene, not sure what his tick would be but the look into the character this way is a good way to hi lite the differences in their paradigms and beliefs. 
Also I think another scene like your first post would be fantastic, doesn't have to be Harry in the tank, but something suspenseful that asks questions. Maybe someone else has a near death experience and see's a loved one. Maybe someone Dole knows or encounters. Maybe Doyle is investigating without Harry, believing it might be a trick. Magic is real and I think it contrasts well with your protagonists. What other none sparkling firework magic could be seen? 
Ok, something I think that could be cool going forward is, Doyle receiving a letter, something mysterious with a bit of broken pick inside... Something later discovered in Harry's lock. When he pulls it out of the lock holding it in his hand it is no longer in the envelope with the note. 
How about a bad guy? I think Harry and Doyle would be fantastic against a good villain. Here's a thought, 
Capitalist who employs child labor and unsafe working conditions, soul ripped to pieces. Believes he was cursed, Harry is led to him because he has been linked to missing children. Somewhere in the conversation, Harry says something about the power of magic on broken souls, referring to himself, this causes "Normand" to think Harry cursed him. Magical and real combat ensues. Eventually Normand does something so terrible trying to kill Harry he breaks his soul and his mind leaves his body completely. Factory fire Harry rushes in to save the children and is faced with a choice of his daughter or the children in front of him, but it is a final restoration he pulls the children from behind the locked door and Doyle manages to flood part of the factory with Lake water giving them a chance to escape. Possibly from madness or possibly magic Harry see's his daughter, a piece of her anyway in each of the saved children and his daughter is brought back into multiple children. Could even throw in a multi person conversation with Harry asking if it's really her and the group answering one word per person in a complete sentence. 

Just thoughts. I have really enjoyed stepping into this world feels more real every week!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["No.Â  Absolutely no," Dobbs said. "No."

Harry ran a hand through his hair.Â  A few feet away Doyle paced, his hands thrust angrily in his pockets.

"A big, strong man like you afraid of a little camera?" Velrsa said.Â  "Tsk, tsk."Â  She pattedÂ  Dobbs' hand.

She was sitting at the seance table with the rest of her "valets", eating breakfast.Â  In the center of the table the camera sat, partially disassembled.Â  Dobbs stared warily at it while he ate.Â  He gestured at it with his fork.

"That thing.Â  No, I'll not have it stealin' me soul.Â  Dress it up 'ow you like, Mr. Harry, but it's evil."Â  He made a warding gesture at the camera.

The ladies had offered Harry and Doyle food also, but they declined, wanting to get the photo taking experiment over as quickly as possible.Â  Dobbs was eating Harry's portion having finished his own and Doyle's a few minutes before.

Dobbs continued.Â  "In the village where I grew up, I heard stories--"

"About this camera?" asked Harry, dubiously.

"You grew up in Brooklyn, you ninny," Doyle said.Â  He had crumpled his hat in his hands until it was bent unrecognizably.

"It's like a village," Dobbs said defensively.Â  He winked at one of the valets as she scooped another helping of eggs onto his plate.

"We need a test subject to set the baseline, Mr. Dobbs" Harry said.Â  "Madame Velrsa has graciously allowed us 10 pictures."

"You consider that price gracious," Doyle muttered.

"Ten pictures," Harry continued, ignoring Doyle.Â  "Doyle was in the War, he has killed people which Velrsa says tears holes in the soul.Â  You were not in the War so...wait have you killed anyone?"

Dobbs looked around the room, which had grown suddenly silent.Â  "No?" he said after a moment.Â  The others in the room exchanged uncomfortable glances.Â  "No," Dobbs said with more conviction.Â  "Took a few lads close but they were all alive when I walked away."

"Wait," Harry said.Â  "Madame, what if Dobbs had killed someone but he did not consider it wrong?"

Velrsa considered for a few moments.Â  "A mercy killing, you mean to say?"

"I told you I ne'er killed no one!" Dobbs protested.Â Â Harry waved a hand to quiet him.

"If," Velrsa said slowly, "if...yes, if Mr. Dobbs did not feel the killing was wrong then his soul might not be torn."

"Good and evil are not subjective," Doyle roared.Â  "Harry, did we come to take this picture or not?"

"I will not be taken in again by some charlatan!" Harry bellowed back.

"She is dead, Harry," Doyle growled.Â  "Dead.Â  Let it go!"

The room was silent.

"So," Dobbs said, pointing a fork at Doyle.Â  "Then 'is soul might be in one piece, too?"

Doyle turned away and looked out the window.Â  Night was coming on and twilight bathed the room in soft light.

"Just take the bloody picture, Harry," Doyle said softly.Â  "Dobbs is too stupid to know right from wrong and I, I am not stupid enough."

Harry pulled his jacket off angrily and made to throw it then stopped and draped it neatly over one of the chairs.

"No one is ever gone until they are forgotten," Harry said to Doyle.Â  "My daughter is not forgotten.Â  And neither is your wife."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bess stared longingly at the door.Â  Her dinner companion was into his fourth Hotty Toddy and proving the old adage that there could be too much of a good thing.Â  She had managed to count the number of candles on the chandelier, its hanging tassels and the sequins on the dress of the woman behind her dinner companion.

Bess had heard of people who could not stop counting, mostly in her days traveling with Harry.Â  One man even rattled off numbers at random for years until they realized allegedly that he was counting everything around him.Â  Bess could understand the draw of using the mundane to combat the brutally boring.

"371," she said suddenly, finishing the sequin count.

The man across from her stopped mid sentence.Â  "Come again?"

Bess blushed.Â  "371.Â  It is a type of..." She scanned around the room, her eyes coming to rest on the glass tumbler in front of her companion.Â  "...a type of whiskey where I am from."

"Oh, where is that?" the man asked.

"Enough about me," Bess said.Â  "What were you saying again, ah...?"Â  <em>Felix....maybe?Â  Fenton?</em>

"Of course, yes, some people--and I will not name names--but I could..." her dinner partner, definitely Fenton, leaned in conspiratorially, "for the promise of an after dinner stroll."

"You are too kind, but it is getting late," Bess said.

"Yes," her companion smiled lewdly.Â  "It is, in fact, getting late."

The chair to her right pulled out suddenly and a man sat down.Â  Bess and her companion looked over shocked.Â  It was Doyle.

"Bess," he said.Â  "We need to speak."

"Excuse me!" Bess's companion said.Â  "What are you doing?"

Doyle ignored him.Â  "Harry is slipping."

"Who is," her companion said the name like it was a disgusting dish, "Harry?"

Doyle looked over annoyed.

"My husband," Bess said.Â  "Soon-to-be ex-husband."

If the fact that Bess had a husband surprised her dinner companion he did not show it.Â  He ignored her and focused on Doyle.Â  "You are interrupting our dinner--"

"Do you know who I am?" Doyle asked.

"No, do you know who--"

Doyle punched Bess's dinner companion squarely in the jaw.Â  He reeled back momentarily and then he fell forward, his face crashing heavily into the table.Â  Doyle picked up the man's head slightly to make sure he had not fallen on a fork or cracked the plate.Â  Satisfied, he dropped the man's head back onto the table and turned back to Bess.

"That technically is my date you punched out, Doyle," Bess said, looking around the room.Â  She tried to smile at the other patrons: <em>Boys will be boys. Â </em>But no one seemed to share her sentiment.Â  She could see the restaurant staff silently arguing about who would approach her and Doyle.Â  Somehow the casualness of Doyle' violence was more intimidating than if he had come in screaming in rage.

"Farrington Wenworth?" Doyle said.Â  "When did you start dating again?Â  I thought you were, ah, waiting for Harry to come around."

<em>Farrington! </em>she thought.Â  Then she was suddenly angry.Â  "I am not one of your tender high society wall flowers, Arthur."

He grinned.Â  "I know."

She felt the old rage buried under ignored sorrow.Â  "You like to see me angry," she said.

His grinned widened.Â  "It's too bad I went to the horse races."

She laughed at their old joke in spite of her anger.Â  She looked around the room.Â  Some people were pointedly ignoring her and Doyle and whispering fiercely while others were still staring.Â  She silently cursed her lack of social knowledge.Â  How should she exit this situation?Â  Where she grew up a punch would have kicked off a full scale bar room brawl.

"We should go," she said.

The manager--Bess assumed it was the manager by the rich cut of his suit--approached the table somewhat cautiously.

"Sir," he said to Doyle.Â  Doyle grabbed Farrington's napkin and placed it on his own lap.

"A bottle of whatever the lady was drinking and a plate of whatever the gentleman was having, if you please.Â  It smells delicious."

The manager spluttered. "Sir, you and your companion--"

Doyle raised a finger.Â  "I am richer and definitely more famous than Farrington Wentworth.Â  Plus," he leaned over and spoke softly, "this establishment will be the talk of the town for weeks."

The manager stared at Doyle then turned to a few of the wait staff who had been hanging back.Â  He nodded at the them.Â  "Of course, sir," he smiled ingratiatingly.Â  "Would the gentleman care for a brandy as well?"

"Splendid suggestion, my good man!Â  Make it two?" Doyle nodded to Bess.Â  She sighed and nodded.Â  The manager gave her a slightly disapproving look then looked fearfully at Doyle and scuttled off towards the restaurant bar.

"It's about Harry," Doyle said again.

"Isn't it always," Bess said.Â  She settled back in her chair for what, as always, promised to be a good story.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My first impression reading this whole thing through is that I get a strong sense of the scenery/vibe of the location even though you don't describe it in depth. The internal monologue at the opening sets up the scene and gives a lot of information about the lead up to that point. I like the subtle nod to Harry, kind of indirect, when she recalls "people who could not stop counting" from "her days traveling with Harry." I think that gives a message that she misses the way things used to be, and it gives the reader insight into her thinking without saying Bess missed Harry. 
I think beside the moment when Doyle punches the guy unconscious, my favorite moment is the "lewd smile" with yes it is getting late. This guy is not reading signals and he is only focused on getting it on. 
The Dialogue is great! I can hear Doyle's tone and baudy demeanor. I am really jealous of your dialogue. This is also a major development in Bess's character and her relationship with Harry. I think it tracks well with the first few posts with her, I think we could maybe use a good story of Bess sorting her feelings and expositing on Harry. She may be a good person to really lay out the conflict that Doyle and Harry are trying to sort. 
The fact that Doyle is so callous is a great insight into his character, I also like his not too platonic back and forth with Bess... it raises questions. The fear of others is a great way to convey a characters intimidating nature. I like the fact Doyle goes on about how he is richer and more famous than the guy he hit, it is haughty, human and also enviable. He is such a strong character, I wonder how you could differentiate and extenuate Harry ? 
I heard about a plot device from Dan Brown, in short he said, there should be a clock counting down. Something to define and outline the need for urgency. I wonder what your clock could be? My thought is that Harry went to a medium when he was younger and they gave him some prophecy with time constraints. Or a third party, maybe occult, could be tied to Vesla, enacting a plan for some date. Or, magic itself is dying, all magic is fading and the time of miracles is almost over. Or the time constraint could be Harry, which is kind of the one you have now, maybe he is manic or more so, maybe he believes that some date, maybe his daughters birthday is his last chance to save her, maybe she is fading in his visions. Just thoughts, really a privilege to read these posts.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks.  Yeah Bess definite has a scene coming of her own maybe two.  

Clock counting down makes sense.  Maybe there are only 12 plates of film (?) that can be exposed for the camera to measure the soul.  Theyâve used 2 and Velrsa(gotta change that name to something I can remember) but there are 10 left and Harry has to do something g to get his 9 chakras aligned or up to par.  Then the film slates start going bad.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory rocked back and forth on her toes covering her eyes with her hand to block the sunlight. An older man and his wife walked up to the crossing and pressed the button hard and long again and again. âThatâs not going to make it go faster, I think once you hit it ya just gotta wait.â Ellory said. The older couple looked at one another and started across the walkway a moment later. Michael thought they were probably saying something about unpleasant about Ellory because they leaned in to whisper as they walked. Ellory looked at Michael and rolled her eyes turning to walk towards the pier. A warm wind pushed a mix of hot sugar, ocean salt and cigarette smoke inland. Ellory breathed deep, â I need a good funnel cake.â The tone was loaded and Michael knew what she meant. He wanted so badly for this to be a good day. Michael blinked, or what felt like a blink, narrowing his eyes too see the pier illuminated against a dark sky. âAlright, lets walk buddy.â A muffled voice said from behind Michael. The Ferris wheel lights, loud airy music, and yummy smells formed an enchanting fog. The night seemed to stretch and flip, a motionless capture of bright and colorful moments in a collage of sensation. Ice cream from a man with a long mustache and gold tooth followed by arcade games and a kiss. Her hair smelled sweet and her brown eyes reflected the light from the Red Caboose hotdog stand. Michael felt someone firmly grasping his hand and pulling very hard. âHey, what are you doing?!â Michaels eyes focused to see his Father looking quizzically at him. âYou scared the shit out of me, that hurt!â  Michael realized his voice was high and squealing. He had fallen into the past. 
Michael blinked again and looked up to see Bailey nose to nose with himself. Her paws did a happy little jostle, partly because of the hot cement and partly happy to see Michael wake up. The pier was crowded and Michael laying on the edge of the sidewalk had attracted a crowd of onlookers. Ellory pushed her way through the people craning their necks and staring at him. â Are you OK!?â Ellory stooped down and put her hand on Michaelâs forehead. Michael took inventory, he was tasting ice cream, a mustard covered hotdog, and feeling like he was being lifted by butterflies in his stomach mixed with hunger and frustration. âI am okâ Michaelâs voice cracked as he spoke and sat up slowly. âWhat happened, did you faint? Do you need water or something?â Ellory said while reaching for Michaels hand and turning to look for a restaurant. I must have de-synchronized Michael thought, his eyes were wide and he still felt like he had a bit of food left to chew. This pier, always makes me feel like the word summer, a strong desire to be close to somebody, usually heat, exciting long nights and like something amazing is happening around the corner. Too many memories with the same sort of tags. Michaels mind kept racing trying to figure out how he bounced around through those memories. He did remember his family going to the pier regularly, he just forgot all the little things until he was in the same place smelling the same things again.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice!  This story is really digging deep on the mind warps :)  I like how memories (which normally are innocuous) can be a bad thing while Michael is back in time.  It's cool because it is not the "remembering this day from a different time flow" thing, but rather it is a world building thing.  The danger of magic or science fiction is that it has to have rules.  It doesn't matter what the rules are as long as they are followed consistently by the author.  So this fainting/father memory episode is cool because it paints some of the rules for us without coming out and stating them.  One of the things I like about your stories is the way that you put in these cerebral workouts in them.  Sometimes after I read this story I just sit and ponder some little puzzle like "what role do memories--very distant ones--have to do with how his time travel works?"  Also the "music" of the pier ties in nicely to his time travel device based on music (if I am remembering that correctly).  Makes the radio dangerous.  What old songs can come on and pull him into a different memory and make him shaky/fainting because he is slipping slightly between worlds?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory pulled Michaelâs wrist, Michael thought of his father pulling him along as Ellory was doing now. âComâon, lets go sit in there.â Ellory said gesturing to a screened in porch by the Hot Dog stand. They walked up the big screens porch and shuffled in. "How about here" Ellory set Michael hand on the edge of the table. âIâll get you a water, you just sit here.â Ellory pulled the chair out for Michael who was about sixty percent there. Michael remembered the Hot Dog stand, it hadnât always had a screened in porch it used to be just wood tables and umbrellas. Michael floated between moments, different tastes, conversations with friends, and faces of waiters and waitresses. Ellory carefully navigated the full dining space with two large water glasses balancing in her hands. âAlright, drink like half of that, I canât have my friend dying, me and Allison arenât talking right now and Zeb is super negative. Not a good time to be down a friend.â Ellory lifted the back of her hand to her forehead in a dramatic gesture. Michael still wide eyed gave a chuckle and shakily reached for his drink. âOh My god, are you actually ok? I should be more serious. How do you feel? Not great?â Ellory wiped her hand on her pants and touched Michael's neck. âYou donât feel hot? Well ya know, like heatâ Michael smiled, Ellory looked at the water glass. âI feel better, not sure what happened but I donât think it will happen again. Whereâs Bailey?â Upon hearing her name Bailey popped her head between Micheal's legs. âDidnât know they let dogs in here?â Michael said. âI didnât ask, thought we might just pretend to be blind if anyone comes, and ya know says something.â Ellory stretched her leg to pet Bailey with her foot, her toes bumped Michael's knee. Ellory pulled her foot back and banged her heel on the foot rest. âOuch!â Ellory said while forcing an embarrassed smile. Michael grinned, his head started to come out of the clouds of the past and the ambient noise of people talking and clinking their plates and silverware became audible. Ellory looked in Michaelâs eyes and Michael started to feel all the little pleasant things around him, the salty and savory air floating stagnantly, his fingers touching the warm metal underside of the chair, Baileys went nose on his leg. âHey folks, my name is Annie and Iâll be your server today. Can I start you out with some hushpuppies?â A bleach blonde waitress asked interrupting the scene. Elloryâs eyes got wide and turned towards Michael expectantly. âUh, yeah! Doesnât that sound yum?â Said Ellory. Michael nodded, still trying to feel things like he had a moment ago. âGood, ok, he is a little mush brain because of the heat but I will help him order in a minuteâ Ellory said to the waitress while holding Bailey back under the table with her leg. âOk, honey. Got to be careful with this heat, I will be right back with those hushpuppies.â Annie said giving a well practiced smile. Ellory propped up her menu âWhatya wanna do after we eat?â She asked. Michael felt himself wash over with a pleasant contentment and a sort of melancholy that the moment so freshly gone would not be remembered and appreciated the way it deserved. 

How do you capture a moment? Something professor Mccalister asked rhetorically while thumbing through assignments. Michael thought about it literally. The professor interrupted Michael's thinking by sliding a piece of paper across his desk. 
âSunny window smile,
Young wiggle in old blue van,
Open door, friends playâ
Haikuâs, Eddie said with cheerful enthusiasm. Eddie went on to explain the imagery in classic Haikuâs and talked about rhyming structure and itâs optional nature and spoke about their potency. Michael, who had come to talk seriously that day and mine advice nodded politely and waited for a moment to shift the conversation. Michael picked up his menu, looking over the pictures hotdogs with slaw and chilli. He thumped syllables on the laminated menu. 
âLong look on a hot day, 
 Smile, eyes meet, feel of salt air
Good time to be hereâ]]></content:encoded>

Yo Jackass,

Tim from the Dispatch.&nbsp; Remember that small town discovered empty in the Mid West a few years back.&nbsp; Someone finally finished digging through it and wrote it up.&nbsp; Came in on the international wire weirdly enough.&nbsp; But too late to make our night run.&nbsp; Bill told me to shoot it your way before I open it up to the highest bidder. 1 photo that I'll send over if you take the piece.&nbsp; Looks too grainy to be useful but maybe your layout guys and design nerds can get creative.

You got 30 minutes, homeboy, then Im opening it up.

oh Bill says to tell Syd: "Debt paid in full with this.&nbsp; Screw you and screw the Lakers."&nbsp; Speaking of bets, you make any headway with that hot piece of ass that started a few months back?&nbsp; haha&nbsp; Business suit girl.

-- Tom

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<em>Dec 9th 1993</em>

<em>-- Deborah Grover, Michael Penrose with assistance from Reggie MacTierney</em>

<em>When you die what will go in that box of "stuff" that describes your life?&nbsp; When a person dies family is given the unenviable job of cleaning out your flat (hopefully with you already having been removed from it.)&nbsp; It is their duty to sort through what you kept from all of the things that passed through your hands throughout your life.&nbsp; What will the things someone packs in a box say about the life you lived?&nbsp; What will it say about you?</em>

<em>The nation was captivated three years ago when the town of Atonville was discovered completely empty.&nbsp; It started with unanswered letters and answering machines that became too full to record.&nbsp; Eventually, people outside of the town began trying to get in contact with their relatives' neighbors and then eventually the local authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

<em>The mysterious disappearance of more than 1,500 people made headlines but was quickly lost.&nbsp; There was a deluge of the international and national headlines dominating the news cycle that week.&nbsp; Even in regional papers the extended coverage was limited to a few, terse sentences buried midway through the Front or Local sections.</em>

<em>Though he did not realize it at the time, the first person to physically set foot in the town was Reggie McTierney, a British journalist on vacation in the US.&nbsp; According to MacTierney, his family's travel route passed through Atonville.&nbsp; He found no one in the town or surrounding county.&nbsp; It was odd but he was not on assignment.&nbsp; He "procured" a few letters to obtain the return address of family members.&nbsp; After arriving in California a few days later he began to make calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

<em>What he discovered is that in spite of numerous attempts to contact people in the town by phone or letter the 4-5 people he spoke with had not gone to the town to investigate personally.&nbsp; MacTierney was a sports writer so he turned the "odd little piece" over to his International desk when he returned to the UK.&nbsp; </em><i>Hundreds of friends and relatives of people in the town were eventually interviewed.&nbsp; </i><em>But even people in the adjacent counties never "got around" to making the short trip.&nbsp; Something always came up.&nbsp; Deliveries for the town piled up at receiving sites in adjacent counties or returned to the original shippers.&nbsp; External vendors with relationships to local retailers had no explanation for why they had let their relationships lag and the accounts receivables go uncollected.</em>

<em>MacTierney was asked to go back with three journalists from the International desk the following month.&nbsp; The trip was delayed.&nbsp; The UK made it into the Cricket World Cup semi-finals and then finals.&nbsp; MacTierney and the correspondents from the International desk were busy covering that story.&nbsp; It was well over a year before the team would travel to Atonville.&nbsp; Much had changed in that time.</em>

<em>The town had significantly deteriorated.&nbsp; Sinkholes had opened and swallowed entire buildings.&nbsp; Trees had fallen across the major thoroughfare in numerous places, restricting travel to some sections of town.&nbsp; Electricity was off in most buildings and there were signs of a large fire in one section.&nbsp;&nbsp;The church bell tower had partially collapsed causing the bell to be in a position where is rang continuously during a strong wind.&nbsp;</em>

<em>In every relatively unscathed building visited there were no signs of struggle or abduction.&nbsp; No chairs had been tipped over.&nbsp; No doors showed signs of forced entry.&nbsp; Nothing had been looted and electronics still sat covered with dust.</em>

<em>In a word it was eerie.</em>

<em>The town's residents had just ceased being in the town--except in one house.&nbsp; The residence of the Danforths (as identified by their collected mail) showed signs that someone had been packing.&nbsp; There were a few suitcases out, partially filled with clothes and toiletries.&nbsp; A rather large bushman's blade had been set by the front door.&nbsp; Opened on desk was a single box containing a few small items...</em>

T-Dog,

Yeah, remember the story, but thought the place was called Sugar Cove or something.&nbsp; I'll have Copy check it.&nbsp; Syd says we'll take it but to put it in your desk drawer and give us a day or two.&nbsp; A lot of popup local stuff coming in unexpectedly.

By the way, bet's done.&nbsp; Looks we'll be buying the rounds this year.&nbsp; (NO TOP SHELF!!) Long story short: Turns out Desiree is a lesbo.&nbsp; Worked her for a month before she finally broke down and admitted it.&nbsp; Swore me to secrecy so of course I told all the other guys so they wouldn't waste time on her.&nbsp; Haha&nbsp; Apparently she heard about it but didn't seem upset.&nbsp; With a name like that and those tits she is probably used to it.

Dear Ma'am,

We came across this old email thread in the archived servers while we were purging.&nbsp;

Due to the offensive nature of some of its content, as per company policy, I have placed "xxxx" over offensive words before sending.&nbsp; I was unsure whether I should remove what apparently is a reference to you.

I sincerely and profusely apologize if I have made an incorrect choice, but your instructions regarding any written or electronic communications of Mr. Bonneville and your predecessor, Mr. Sydney Stanwick, are still active policy in my department.

There is a news article referenced in the email.&nbsp; Mr. Bonneville's replacement searched her desk and found a printed copy of the article wedged behind one of the drawers.&nbsp; (Security apparently missed the paper when they were cleaning it out after you terminated Mr. Bonneville.)

Please let me know how to proceed.

Dhruv Praveen

Director of IT

<hr>

Dhruv,

Thank you for forwarding that on.&nbsp; FYI, you are the hero of the week over here.&nbsp; I shared it with some others who were around during Mr. Bonneville's time.&nbsp; We all got a real kick out of it.

You can toss the article.&nbsp; I vaguely remember it hitting the national cycle the first time but if anyone had discovered something interesting about the town it would have ended up back in the news cycle.

On a personal note, my husband and I enjoyed meeting you and your spouse at the New Years Eve party.&nbsp; Let us hope that the 2000's bring us a different world than the one with which we all started.

Desiree Westbrook-Smith

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rodney flicked a match, the flame flickered as it fell to the ground landing next to scattered half burnt matches. âI think TJ is the guy, he doesnât seem capable of anything planned, I know. But let's be honest Dan, if a pack of chocolate pudding goes missing from the cafeteria, who do they blame?â Dan hesitantly lifted a finger towards Rodney. âThatâs right me. And they are right to do so, I will never tell them that but we know it. Donât we.â Rodney put his arm around Dan conspiratorially âSo if someone, say a pretty young girl with a hot headed ex boyfriend goes missin?â Rodney thumped Danâs chest to punctuate his argument.  âIt has got to be him, he knocked out that kindergarten school teacher throwing that orange at Devan. Remember that, Devan threw an Orange at TJ who picked it up to throw it back and Devan ducked. Just a playful toss, knocked her out cold.â Dan grimaced thinking about the loud thwack of orange on skin. âSo your theory is that TJ accidently killed Sarah with another fruit mishap?â Dan said knocking Rodneyâs arm off his shoulder. âWho knows the situation, maybe he was throwing rocks at her window to win her back or whatever and let one slip?â Daniel shook his head. âOk not exactly that but maybe he just hugged the shit out of her? He once pulled off a door handle, one of those metal ones bolted to the big school front door. The kid has weird awkward strength, but at the worst timesâ Rodney waited for Daniel to respond to his squished Ex theory. âOk, so lets say he just accidentally brutalises her like a little rabbitâ Daniel began but was cut off. âWait, what? What the hell is wrong with you? Who thinks of brutalises rabbits? Creep.â Rodney interjected. âItâs from a book you were supposed to read in Sophomore English. Didnât know you liked rabbits so much?â Dan said, Rodney furrowed his brow. âSounds weird. And they are, well you know â¦. little cute furry shits. Whatever man what's your theory â Rodney lifted his hand for Dan to proceed. âShe is missing, Right? So, TJ wouldnât have just accidentally killed her he would have had to hide her body. Also, I do want to say, Sarah could be alive. Maybe she is just running away to some estranged Aunts house or something. Or maybe she is hooked on Marijuana?â Dan said looking to his friend who was in the middle of flicking another match. â I donât wanna be Mr. bad news guy, but she is not alive. She has been gone, like off the grid gone for five days. She has been squished like a rabbit by a hormonally overcharged Ex. It has gotta be him. But, letâs say for âwhodunitâ sake she is dead and we donât know for a fact TJ offed Sarah, if we had to come up with a list of other people who do you think it could be?â Rodney said while watching a match burn down to his fingertips. âWell, just operating on the idea that she is dead, which she could totally not be, but just for conversation, I think it could have been a drifter or somethin. Sarah is, or was, super nice and if someone came up and asked her for directions she would totally have just gone with themâ Dan turned to face where he had been standing âOh you want to know where the secluded abandoned meat factory is?â Dan said imitating Sarh, he turned again. âYes little girl guide me. Guide meâ¦â Dan paused his imitation to gauge Rodneyâs expression. âOk, that coulda happened. I get the picture. But no one has seen any weirdoâs around, I think, in a town like this someone would have been all over a stranger after a girl goes missingâ Rodney said. âWell the stranger could have come from Elling or Rocktown and just been driving through looking for someone. Sarah went missing at night, Mr. S said that sort of thing happens more often at night. She left the Pep rally around 9:15 and biked towards Jackie Hughes house. Creep coulda got her on the way.â Dan said defending his theory. âWhere's the bike? Would a random creepy dude have taken the bike too? He would have had to put it precariously in his car which would be tough. Or he could have had a truck, admittedly the creep could have had a truck. But why take something that could link him to the kidnapping?â Rodney looked up at Dan who was pacing with his hands behind his back. Dan snapped and said âHe didnât, he just left it and it was stolen. I have had two bikes stolen. Or maybe he took it and hid the bike in Hall park or some other wooded area? It could be that he just took the bike and is slowly melting it down bit by bit in a kiln.â Rodney searched his backpack and pulled out a tattered piece of paper. â Ok, I am making an official list. Top of the Murderer list goes, drumroll please, TJ. Second unknown creep from out of town. Next?â Rodney looked up for additional names to add to the list. âWhat I just gave the last one! Itâs your turn.â Dan said. âFine, Principle Barnes, mean, degrading, hates kids.â Rodney hissed and started to write. âWhat! No way, one, Principle Barnes is a nice guy you just donât like him because he makes you pull gum out from underneath tables when you skip class. Second, he, along with like everyone at the school liked Sarah. She was never in trouble, like ever. Third the man is almost eighty uses a cane. Finally he was at the pep Rally sleeping next to coach until the teachers woke him up to go home.â Dan listed his points on his fingers as we went. âWell he could have had help, what about Vice Principle Spike? Or Mrs. Guthrieâ Rodney gritted his teeth. He scribbled so forcefully he broke the lead of the pencil.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Guthrie was the teacher Rodney likes?  Anyways I like the banter and the development of secondary characters through the discussions of the primary characters.  Good world building tidbits with the stolen bike bit (2 bikes stolen).  Also, I like the downplaying of the principal's character.  As the reader starts to get further in and they catch on the the theme they will suspect the principal to be hiding the fact that he is actually playacting being weak and is therefore a prime suspect.  Also it gives the scene a good organization of the plot.  Now the characters have a plan of who to meet next etc and the readers know what is coming (or at least the characters' objectives) and where the plot appears to be going.  Always fun when you try to outsmart the author and figure out where his is going first before he gets there.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael, a tall and languid looking fellow marched down the street. Matches trickled behind him as his fingers bumbled over and through a large box of matches. Tin music meant to entertain sleepless seniors poured from poorly disguised speakers along the shops on the main street. Thumb and forefinger gripped a set of matches, some facing one way and the rest another. Andy Williams cooed irresponsible as the thump and grind of matches came alight. Michael looked at the burning matches preparing to bring it to his pipe. Wispy clouds ran across the dark blue sky, turning silver briefly as their backs crossed the moon. Michael too was running, from this moment to the next and he for a brief moment had crossed some light that brought it to his mind. Thinking on this he forgot about the lit pieces of wood in his hand and wasnât brought to awareness but for a tickling of heat. The tiny spark plopped to the brick street bellow and extinguished with it some of the moonlight vanished as a fat dark cloud lumbered across the sky. Thoughts of breathing, buying air, holding the rented breath as long as he could stand it, then releasing it, altered and contorted.

The thick air laden with water and holding close was peeled back by a cool breeze that felt empty. Lightning flashed high above. The dark red road turned black in one spot then another as plump droplets smattered. This moment of thinking and running from the un-thought of cascade of one thing to another was interrupted, and some emotion in this case self preservation and fear of being burned to a crisp by a bolt of lightning drove Michael to disconnect from the pull of unsettling ideas and into the feeling of danger which was much closer. He tucked his pipe into his pocket and started jogging down the long road towards shelter. Wind turned up sleepy tree branches whipping up the leaves and revealing lighter green bellies reflecting the street lights. A loud clap of thunder released a falling wave of water, first several feet behind Michael, then right on his heels, then covering him over.

Another flash and the street lights died out. Michael stopped his heart rushing in his ears and clothes dripping he looked around to orient himself. The wind rushing, water falling made the street feel different. Michael squinted and peered towards where he knew he should go, he saw moon shaped circle and upon lifting his hand to his forehead and blocking the deluge for a moment determined it to be the clock tower. He walked towards it no longer running due to the obscured ground sunken beneath a layer of water. The circle gradually grew larger, Michael walked with small steps feeling the warm street underneath the cool water. A solid thump told Michael he had reached the edge of the stairs leading to the quad. He was close to his dorm, to getting out of the storm. He felt for the hand rail and hopped up the stairs, the clock face peeking from between the swaying branches of large pin oaks. Over the roar of water striking the ground Michael heard bells chiming from the tower. He stared at the clock face absorbed by the pounding rain on his body and clothes, the sound of his heart in his ears, the other-worldly chime of old church bells. The moment stretched, in all motion he still felt.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love the imagery and the sounds (i.e., chimes and also the tinny speakers with irritatingly happy music) that create powerful imagery.  Also the little poetry and disconnected / jumping alliteration.  Gives it a good beat to the flow of the words.  What time frame is this?  It feels like unmodified present (UnmP?  UP?).  Is he following the notes somewhere?  I always wondered how he got from the present to the past and what the experience was like.  I keep thinking he is following sounds like anchor chains down into the past.  Like memories of her voice drop him into his "past" body.

On this sentence:  "Michael, a tall and languid looking fellow marched" i am wondering if you should use "Michael, a tall and languid,".  You have a really good impressionist flow through the piece and I think trimming that first sentence down gets the reader immediately in the staccato word flow.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some nights the town just sucked.

Ethel loved her little town most days and had made peace with her waitressing job a long time back.Â  Unlike a lot of people she had been outside of the county for a while so she secretly considered herself just slightly more cultured than the rednecks and sleepy truckers who frequented the diner during the late hour shift.

"They're back," Betty said, looking over at Ethel.Â  Betty was short, plump and managed to say every statement with a shit-eating grin.Â  In 20 years, Ethel had never seen Betty's smile falter.Â  If there was a person that all of the world's cults missed out on it was Betty.

"So I see," Ethel said, not looking up from her crossword.Â  She had come in for her first shift, served a few Ironhorse Cowboys (the county's pseudo-biker gang), and been idle ever since.

The 'they' were Reginald T. Holmes and Mr. Tight-Ass-Yes-Baby.Â  Reginald was an infrequent customer who showed up once a fortnight at most and just sat and drank bad coffee for a shift or two.Â  He was quiet and kind of meely-mouthed.Â  Every once in a blue moon Mr. Yes-Baby would appear with him.Â  The two always took the same booth (second from the last) and chit chatted in low voices.

No one was sure who had given Mr. Yes-Baby is nickname but strangely it fit.Â  If Brad Pitt had had a wet dream about his hotter self that would be Mr. Yes-Baby.Â  He was tall, blonde, and so good looking a girl's eyes would hurt if she looked at him too long.Â  (Betty tried it once hiding in the kitchen.Â  She swore she saw spots for a week after that).

In Ethel's opinion, Mr. Holmes seemed not to like Mr. Yes-Baby.Â  When Mr. Holmes thought no one was looking he stared daggers at Mr. Yes-Baby.Â  So the queer rumors never really took.Â  To Ethel it almost seemed like Mr. Holmes was guarding the diner from his sexy friend.Â  He watched Yes-Baby like a hawk, even counting the forks and utensils when the latter left for the night.

"Can I get more coffee?" said a voice so deep it almost purred.Â  Everyone turned.Â  They always did.Â  Like marionettes on a string.Â  Mr. Yes-Baby was holding up his coffee cup.

In her haste to get over before anyone else, Betty practically bowled over a biker at the cash register who was waiting to pay his bill.Â  She expertly grabbed the coffee pot on the way by and came skidding to a halt in front of Holmes' and Yes-Baby's table.

Betty smiled somehow wider and Ethel turned away in mild irritation and disgust.Â  Most nights Ethel loved her small quaint town but every once in a while it just felt like a suffocating wet blanket that she could never find the edge of.

Across the room Betty cackled in that way that she thought sounded titillating.

"I've got to get a vacation soon--," Ethel muttered.Â  Across the room she heard someone groan.

"Mr. Holmes," she heard Betty say.Â  "Are you all right?Â  You look a little pale."

Ethel sighed and turned back to her crossword again.Â  She heard Yes-Baby laugh uproariously, probably at something Betty had said.

"Who am I kidding," Ethel muttered.Â  "This place is as good as most places, maybe better."Â  Yes-Baby was still laughing and it sounded like he was close to tears he was laughing so hard.Â  For some reason right at that moment she thought she could punch Mr. Yes-Baby square in the face and it would feel pretty good.

After a moment the odd thought passed.Â  "Ava!" Ethel said.Â  She had just figured out a piece of her puzzle.Â  "Ava Gardner!"Â  Then she sighed.Â  If it was right it made a few of her other answers wrong.

"I hate the New York Times," Ethel murmured and tossed the crossword in the trash.Â  Somewhere around there had to be a County Reveler paper that no one had gotten to the crossword on yet.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Carl,
I think this piece is great. It is meandering, I can imagine getting coffee at this place, just sitting feeling a comfortable sort of boredom. I think especially when writing about a small town this type of cozy imagery of local places and personalities allows people to fill in so much about the town. I like Betty, something about a short fat waitress makes me smile. This enigma of a character yes baby is great too. I love your dialogue and in this I wanted more, I hope we get to come back here and hear these people carry on about anything!! I saw in a video, one of those adds for masterclasses on writing my browser thinks I need to see, that every character wants one thing, they are motivated by one thing and it informs their actions. What do these guys want? Betty wants yes-baby haha.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doyle shook his head.Â  "This has to be the most idiotic--"

Harry waved a hand violently, shushing Doyle.Â  "Quiet!" he hissed.Â  "Dobbs is in position."

Doyle leaned his head against the alley wall and stared up into the clouds as if for inspiration.Â  "Crazy," he muttered.

Harry ignored him.Â  At the entrance to the alley he could see Dobbs talking to a old woman.

"What is he waiting for?" Harry whispered.

"Perhaps he is out of practice," Doyle said.

Harry looked back.Â  "I thought you said he had done this before."

"I said probably he had done this before," Doyle corrected.

At the entrance, Dobbs casually dropped a white handkerchief at the same time he reach towards the old woman's purse.

"The signal," Harry said.

"Wait!Â  Harry, not--"Â  Doyle started.Â  Harry ignored him, leaping to his feet.Â  He ran towards Dobbs and the woman.Â  As he neared the entrance he yelled "Stop, thie--"

Which was when the old woman swung her purse into his face.Â  "Get back, cretin!" she yelled.

Harry had been traveling so fast that the force of her blow was magnified.Â  His legs outpaced his head and he fell onto his back, sliding across the sidewalk and partially into the street.

"Mr. 'arry!" Dobbs yelled, concerned.Â  He reached a hand out to pull Harry back then fell like a sack of bricks as the old woman's purse slammed into the back of his neck.Â  Unfortunately, he fell onto the already prone Harry who let out an "ooff".

"Wait!" he moaned raising a hand toward to ward off the old woman's next blow.Â  He was partially successful as she mistook his hand for Dobbs' head and swung wildly at it.Â  Harry pulled it back just in time then cried out as his elbow slammed into the sidewalk.Â  The old woman began slamming her purse into Dobbs' exposed back.Â  The big man howled in pain.

"What is going on here!" a voice yelled.Â  It was Doyle.Â  He had run out of the backside of the alleyway and around the block to look like he was approaching from a different direction.

"Purse thieves!" the old woman shrieked.Â  She raised her purse for another strike but Doyle caught her hand.

"I will handle this," he said.Â  He pulled Dobbs up and grabbed him by the lapels.Â  "You, what are you--"

Then he stopped as Dobbs' eye bulged out.Â  Doyle looked down to see the old woman's cane which she had just swung with all her might into Dobbs' groin from behind.Â  He dropped Dobbs' who groaned and cupped his hand around his groin gingerly, but protectively.

"I said--" Doyle started, but had to dodge the wild kick the woman put into Dobbs' side.Â  She stepped back, panting.Â  Harry was starting to get up.Â  The old woman's eyes locked onto him and she started to raise her cane.

Doyle grabbed Harry, pulled him up and punched him in the stomach.Â  Harry fell to his knees and then onto the ground clutching his stomach.

"Run," Doyle said to the woman.Â  "I will hold these men until the constables arrive."Â  The old woman nodded graciously then wacked Dobbs on the way with her cane by for good measure.

Doyle watched until she had turned the corner.Â  He turned back to Dobbs and Harry who were starting to climb to their feet.

"You," Harry said then wheezed, "punched me, Arthur!"

"Yes," Doyle smirked.Â  "I had to make it look believable or else she would still be here pummeling the two of you."

"Caught me off guard," Dobbs muttered.Â  He spat out something that looked suspiciously like a tooth to Harry.

"Come on, gents, enough good deeds for one night," Doyle said.Â  He muttered something under his breath then said, "We need to get 'Harry the Hero' out of here before she brings down the entire constabulary."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Haha, this is a fun bit. I think this is a nice excerpt into the lives of these gentlemen. I think the plan of stopping a fake thievery also gives us some rule building in this world as to how Harry can repair his soul. I like Doyle's role in all of this, the dissenting but still participating part who comes to a heavy handed rescue. I like that we get more Dobbs, he is great comedic relief and a good contrast to Harry and Doyle's analytical styles. I think the scene links well with the build up and we start to see the characters try to fix the conflict and starts putting in place the guard rails guiding us to the rising action.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doyle stared at the wall, waiting.Â  Harry could see every muscle in his body was tensed, ready to...actually, Harry had no idea what Doyle was readying himself for.

Madame Zoska checked the camera's lenses for a final time.Â  "This worked last time, my dears, so let us see if we can delve once more into the Spirit Realm with our questions."Â  Her voice purred slightly.

"You are enjoying this," Harry said sourly though his professional curiosity was piqued.Â  <em>How does a fraud act when she is unexpectedly proven to be true?</em>

"Did you bring the offerings?" Madame Zoska asked.Â  Doyle did not acknowledge the question so Harry bent over and retrieved a small flask and a bag of something fragrant.Â  He handed it to the medium.

Zoska poured the contents of the bag into a small bowl and lit the with a nearby candle.Â  Smoke quickly filled the room, stinging Harry's eyes.

"<em>Nochmal</em>?" someone asked.

"What was that, Doyle?" Harry asked.Â  He was having trouble finding his seat.

"What?" Doyle said.

"Frisch geschnittenes heu."

Doyle's face loomed out of the smoke.Â  "You brought hay?Â  Why hay?"

The smoke was starting to clear.Â  "My dears," Zoska said quietly.Â  "Perhaps--"

"One moment of quiet, please, madame," Doyle snapped.Â  "What about the hay, Harry?"

Harry shook his head then when he realized Doyle could not see it said, "I did not say anything about hay, Doyle."

"Kein gas!"

"Open a window, Dobbs!" Doyle yelled.Â  He jumped to his feet.Â  "Harry, come on!Â  They are gassing us!"Â  He grabbed Harry's arm forcefully and pulled him up.

"Oh dear!" Madame Zoska said.Â  Through the haze Harry felt her grab his wrist.Â  Hard.

"Harry, come on, God damn it!" Doyle bellowed.Â  He yanked Harry forward, half pulling, half dragging him across the table.Â  Zoska yanked hard on his wrist and he slid back towards his chair.Â  He yelled in pain.

Something was wrong.Â Â The room was starting to clear of smoke.Â  Harry looked around and saw Dobbs struggling to open the window.Â  Harry had trained himself over the years to separate his perception from his body.Â  It was how he was able to stay calm for his tricks--panic was Death.

"Kein gas!" Zoska said again, more frantically.

"Not gas," she said.

Her voice, Harry thought.Â  It sounded different both times.Â  Why did it--

"Doyle, stop," Harry said suddenly.Â  If he had yelled it Doyle would have not registered it, but Harry's voice was so calm that it stopped Doyle's frantic pulling.Â  He turned back and looked at Harry with wide, wild eyes.

"What?"

"Was willst du von mir?" Zoska said.

"What?" Doyle said again, but slowly.Â  He looked past Harry to Zoska.

"Wieso rufst du mich an?" Zoska said.

"I did not call..." Doyle's next word died on his lips.Â  He peered intently at the old medium.

"Gott im Himmel," Doyle said.

"Nicht Gott," Zoska said.Â  She smiled crookedly.Â  "Nicht Himmel"

"No," Doyle said.Â  "I do not suppose it would be Heaven for you, old friend.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dusty town hall an alarm beeps in a supply closet. A thin woman reaches over slowly and taps the off button. She was standing staring at a poster for a play, our town which had been put on ten years earlier. She shook back and forth quickly twisting her body removing the weeks worth of dust that had accumulated on the plain brown dress that draped her thing frame. Her hands moved her cheeks moving her face as if to position it. She grabbed her school briefcase and a plastic apple and slowly opened the door. It was still dark and the town hall was empty. Emilee moved between the wooden folding chairs and paper cups with remnants of coffee. For a minute she looked out the window observing the still town with its homes and businesses outlined in grayish black. âWhy would anyone like this place?â She said in a slow whisper. âBâCuz ah da bridges imma put right on the hiweighsâ Said a gruff voice. Emilee turned to see a short stocky man crawling from beneath the wooden stairs. âGrenjamin, I didn't know we would be seeing you this fall. You mean to say repairing I assume. You canât mean on highway ten, that would lead out of town. No way he would give money for a road out of town.â Emilee said sharply, her tone both corrective and absolute. âDas whad I bin told sista, and I am gonna make duh finestâ Grenjamin pulled a thick cigar out of his overall pockets and sank it clumsily into his mouth. âBridges, he told me to make the ones last a long ways, a hundeh years he says to me. I says alright mista, I can do it.â Grenjamin said straightening out his back. Gren patted his back side pockets then his front then looked to Emilee and stuck his finger out. Emilee sighed and stuck her finger out like Gren and a green flame puffed out of the end of her finger. âI am happy you have something you are excited about Gren. You had best get to it, I have my work to see to as well.â Emilee straightened Grens overalls and then opened the door. Emilee saw Grichael coming out of a man hole, yawing and holding a lit cigarette on the end of his lips. âHave a productive day Griâ Emilee said walking by as the even shorter and stalkier man recovered the manhole. âThanksya, you know who got us somthin good! And Emilee you mustâve been growin agin, you should trim down sumâ Gri said whipping something unspeakable off his white undershirt. âThank you for sharing, Grenjamin neglected to tell me as much.â Emilee said stopping showing her profile to Grichael. Loud snaps like twigs being broken in two could be heard one after the other. Emilee dropped two inches. âTheres ya go!â Gri said. Ya do your good stuff Emilee, we are all still workin here cuzza you.â Emilee reached up and pushed her cheeks up a tiny bit making the smallest of smiles on her pale plain face. Then a moment later she pushed her cheeks back down into a flat affect. âThat was a kind thing to say.â E said flatly. âI am going to go now, starting my favorite project today. Mayors of Pleasant Valley.â Emilee nodded shortly and turned to walk towards the school.Â Â </span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mayors plural?  Interesting. Also, I can't remember what the bridges were for or why Shindigo wanted them.  Should it be money that he is giving or essence?  Something that deities deal in as currency.

 I like the name convention Gri / Gre.  I am wondering if in each town there is an Emilee, a Grenjamin, a Grichel and so on.  Not the same being but it is sort of a role.  I added a character matrix so we could see all of the interconnections in the town.  I'd say put these guys and let's map out their interconnections.  

Not sure if there is a way to do the same thing for plot]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[âHow are you?â Dalton asked not looking up from his book.
âI am alrightâ Michael responded in drained exhale. Dalton, eyes fixed on the page reached his hand and slid open a drawer retrieving a blue business card and fit it neatly between the pages and closed the book. âHave a seat if you like?â Dalton gestured towards the sofa. Michael leaned into the cushions and lifted his feet up onto the pillows then faced his friend. âOk, how are you?â Michael asked. âMe? I am fine, a little confused about this philosophy paper, but other than that I am doing very well. How about yourself?â Dalton asked.
Michael nodded and waited for his turn to talk, but when the time came he started one sentence then another not knowing what he wanted them to say. âLet me start over, I have a question but really itâs just something I want to, or need to talk about, and just get it out so I can think about it.â Michael waved his hands and pulled in some imaginary rope as if to draw the words in. âOk, I am listening, lets get it figured out.â Dalton said. âWho do we become friends with? Why do we pick some people to get close to and not others? There is more to it than that, but thatâs a lot of it. I donât know why but it has been really really bothering me.â Michael looked at his friend and shrugged. âI look at people in the grocery store or just walking by and I imagine what they might be like as friends. It is really kind of a selfish thing too, because part of the thing that has been bugging me is how many people am I missing out on who I would really like. I am not gonna go start talking to everybody and make them my friends, I am not suddenly struck by the need to make everyone my friend. It is just that, I am more aware of how much I am missing by not getting to know strangers walking by. I think that maybe I am just chemically off a bit, maybe I need more sleep?â Michael possited.
Dalton pressed his index and middle fingers together. âWell, I donât think you could go wrong by getting more sleep.â He paused and straightened a pencil on his desk. âBut I donât think it is a bad thing to think about relationships, why you have the ones you do and not others. My dad says, life is all about relationships. I think he is right, and I see that as I get older. But I donât think you are so uncomfortable with all of your relationships, I think people choose based on proximity and common interest primarily. I think in a lot of ways we are simple in who we pick. I also think we canât control who we have which is both an unfortunate thought and a comforting one. We have little control concerning who is around.â Dalton leaned forward in his desk chair âBut we do have control over the type of friend we are. I think focusing on little ways you can improve the relationships, the ones you actually are lucky enough to have is a good place to start.â Dalton leaned back. Michael pulled air through his nose. âThat is a very good answer to a lot of questions. But it is not one I like. I donât think I asked my question right.â Michael thought. âThanks buddy, this is why we come to you with this stuff.â Michael said standing up to leave. âWell I am studying itâ Dalton beamed sitting up taller and reaching for his book. âWant me to close the door?â Michael asked. âYes, thank youâ Dalton said retrieving the business card from its snug position between pages.]]></content:encoded>

"Doyle." Harry said softly.Â  Doyle angled his head slightly toward Harry but did not look at him.

"Doyle," Harry repeated, walking towards him.

Madame Zoska put a hand on Harry's arm to hold him back.Â  "Quickly," she hissed.Â  She pointed towards one of the seats around the table then took her own.Â  "Quickly," she said.Â  "He is close."

Harry took his seat.Â  "Who is close?"

"The German," Zoska said.

"In the entire 'spirit world'," Harry made a disgusted face, " there is a single German?Â  What happened to the rest?Â  There is a single--"

"For him, yes," Zoska said.Â  She removed a deck of cards from her inner coat pocket.Â  She quickly shuffled them and spread them across the table.Â  Harry started to rise but she grabbed his arm.Â  She was surprisingly strong.Â  "It is not for you."

"Your German friend, yes?" Madame Zoska said to Doyle who continued to stare off into the distance.

"Can you hear him?" Doyle asked absently.Â  He looked back at Harry and Zoska.Â  "Can you?"

They looked at each other and then shook their heads slowly.

"For a moment," Harry said.Â  "Possibly.Â  I heard something."

Zoska dealt a card and showed it to Harry.

"The King of Spades," he said.Â  Zoska nodded.Â  She drew another card but held it face down.

"You hear someone speaking to you?" he asked Doyle.

Zoska showed the card to Harry.Â  Harry picked up the first card and looked at it.Â  "They are both the king of spades?"Â  Zoska shrugged and drew another card.

"Harry," Doyle said, "he wants to know what you want."

"What I want?" Harry asked.Â  "From the...ghost?"Â  Zoska started to draw another card, but Harry put a hand up to stop her.

"He says you called him, Harry.Â  He wants to go back.Â  And..." Doyle listened.Â  "And he is angry at being forced back to the..."Â  Doyle cursed colorfully.Â  "My German is horrible."

"The man or the language?" Harry asked.

Doyle scowled at him.Â  "The language," he growled.Â  His eyes lost focus.Â  "The pain.Â  He is back to the pain."

"What does that mean?" Harry asked Zoska.

"How the bloody Hell should I know?" Doyle roared think Harry was asking him.

"What is 'the pain'?" asked Harry.Â  "You are sure you hear someone?"

"I hear two someones chattering in my ear," Doyle said.Â  "Stop drawing those damn cards," he snapped at Zoska.Â  She hesitated then set the deck down.Â  "He says...time is pain."

"What?" Harry asked.

"I told you I don't bloody well know, Harry," Doyle yelled.Â  "It is 'Time is pain' or pain is time'.Â  Stupid asinine German sentence structure.Â  No wonder they lost the bloody war.Â  Cannot even complete an understandable sentence."Â  Doyle cursed again.

Zoska pushed the deck of cards towards Harry and gestured for him to deal one.Â  Harry violently shook his head.Â  Zoska threw up her hands, stood up and walked over to the tea service sitting by the doorway.

"I do not have any goddamned beer," Doyle said.Â  "Harry, ask him.Â  He is blowing out my ears with his yelling."

"That is a feat," Harry muttered.Â  "Ask him where my daughter is."

Doyle listened for a moment.Â  "He says 'she is too high'."

"Doyle, if this is some sort of joke--"

Doyle slammed his fist into the plaster wall.Â  It cracked slightly.

"Sorry," Harry said.Â  "It is just that sometimes youÂ <em>want</em> so hard to believe that I--"

"Too high," Doyle repeated.Â  "Something about purity and war and dirt.Â  No, war and being dirty.Â  God, that is right if anything ever was."

The two men looked at Zoska who only stared back coolly.

"I think she may be in Heaven, Harry.Â  Too far from him."

"Ask him what the Devil looks like," Harry said.

"He says the Devil looks like a short, rude magician who drags his friends into terribly odd situations."

Harry was silent for a moment.Â  "Did he really say that?"

"Of course not!" Doyle yelled.

"Your souls--the German, the Soldier and the Liar--are too corrupted to get to her," Zoska said.

"Ask her if he can bring her back," Harry said suddenly.

Doyle frowned.Â  "He says bring him 'the good' and he will find 'the girl'.Â  I may be translating that wrong."

"He wants--what does he want?" Harry asked.

"The cards," Zoska said.Â  Harry looked down and expertly spread them in his nimble fingers.Â  The were all the king of spades.

"We are all soiled in our souls, Unbeliever," Zoska said.Â  "Your friend's German wants to rise to Heaven and will find your daughter there."

"What does he want me to do?" Harry asked.

"Good," said Doyle and Zoska at the same time.

"He wants you to purify your soul and give him those clean parts," Doyle added.Â  "Or so it sounds to me."

"How am I supposed to do that?" Harry asked.Â  "How do you clean your own soul?"]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow, intense! I definitely think the plot developed a lot of fidelity and direction. I really like the inclusion of the German soldier  especially with the conversation with Doyle. I think the after life structure is displayed without overreliance on monologues from characters. I think the name of the fortuneteller change, LOL! I really like how this sets up the direction and expands on the conflict the characters are dealing with.  I think the soldier is a good vehicle to explain the conflict even more so than the fortuneteller. I think the inclusion a supernatural person gives some mystery and intrigue to the otherwise grounded yet engaging characters.  I think the somewhat selfish motivation of the German soldier to ascend higher is a good motivation and a grounded motivation. Having the deceased soldier want something relatable makes the mysticism feel familiar.  I would love to see where the oil and the German soldier and app and a fork in their relationship, do they end up talking about the war? Do they end up talking about their unfortunate run in? Is there forgiveness? What does Doyle want to say to him? I think this arc as well as the arc of Harryâs daughter would be compelling and a way to dive into the characters.  I think we should talk about where we want to land when we have finished the stories. I know for me I struggle figuring out what each week is going to be about, so I think it would be really helpful to work backwards. Maybe write multiple endings and just see which one feels best.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Treeâs mark time in an agreeable manner. Unlike people who mark time in a startling and often unsettling way. It is one thing to get older, it is another entirely for loved ones to do it. Worst still for them to hide for a few years and transform secretly. Age is nice when you are young, each year is a cascade of new things each year with new abilities, it would be nice if others would stay fixed as we grow. Green leafs grow higher each year supported by thicker sturdier trunks. That is more nice, I think. Michael thought looking out on a huge pin oak shadowing a playground.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Treeâs passed out the window of our navy mini van coming home from a long day. Michael stared out the window as the sun warmed the glass on our passage through a seemingly never ending parking lot thinking as the rolled. Up and then down I jostled as the wheels mounted and fell over the bright yellow speed bump. Coffee and nail polsih filled my nose. I held my breath and counted, only taking breaths through my mouth every twentieth second or so. A breeze met my face as my mother mercifully rolled down the window to let out the thick scent. I stopped counting and let out a sigh of relief. A thought meandered pleasantly by like a neighbor saying hello. âWhat would I do when I get home?â Hmm, I waived at the idea of playing in the treehouse. I saluted the notion of biking down the big hill. Finally I met the plan to swing high on the rope swing I built.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was good, I am happy to great that idea and follow it a ways. I picture a ship flying through the air with me at the helm dodging tree tops and evading hungry air wolves. Thump and bump breaks me out of the chase for a brief moment as the tires climb and descend another yellow speedbump. A gaggle of geese block the road and the vanâs exit of the vast lot is temporarily blocked. My neck cranes as I look over the seat to see small baby geese waddle and hop onto a concrete median. My mother thumped her fingers heavily on the wheel, I donât know why. As the last tiny webbed foot clears our path the van hums and chugs forward. I feel my chest rise as we ascend. From my perch I can see the geeselings hop into the pond one by one. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The neighborly thought comes knocking again and I hold my nose and plunge back under huge billowy sails a mile high. The van reaches the peak of the hill and my chest descends. My ship figurehead faces down flies towards the earth below, but I stand gripping the wheel unflinching as my crew, captain puppy and first mate kitty grab the railing and look to me with absolute confidence. The tiny square of farmed fields get larger and the whoosh of air is intense. I laugh this is just like all the times before, me and my shipmates do this everyday. Finally the grains of the plants can be seen swaying as the shadow of my 18th century flying machine nears the earth. All at once I lean back release the halberd line, turn the tackles and pull firmly back on the ships wheel. Phooosh, where there was dark brown fields at the front of the ship now bright sea of blue sky and thick white clouds could be seen as the ship pulled up. The ships whishes through the field inches above the ground cutting through the grain. Captain puts a hand on my shoulder and we laugh, he never doubted me for a second. A light turns from a dark yellow to red and the van stops. Again I look up to see my mother thumping the wheel. I canât wait to go play. I feel the smallness of myself, and the immenseness of time rolling out before me. Tap Tap.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael smiled. He sat up from in between the speakers on his dorm room floor and slid the intensity scale knobs back to their off position. He liked that one very much. â88.345 Mhz with coffee and nailpolish, getting more accurate in moment targetingâ He wrote. He felt a paw on his shoulder closed his eyes and got back on the ship.Â </span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That is a great opening sentence, well constructed.  Since it is a story where time is almost a character it plays well to discuss (?) / describe time the way other things experience it.  "Agreeable" is an unexpected word choice too.  Gives the narrator and the flavor of the piece just that slight hint of distance.  I like the nail polish but think you should do more with it.  The coffee too.  Michael's mother is tapping her fingers it shows she is either bored or impatient (feels like the second).  I would have her using the nail polish at each stop.  Ask L if nail polish does or used to dry better when you waived your fingers around like a pianist limbering up to play.  That gives you fluid movement, color contrast (i.e., nails with and without polish) especially if the light makes the nails look like blood as the light from outside the windshield hits it, and the mom driving with increasing less fingers on the wheel.  If that is her character.  Or you can take it in the other direction.  Each nail done with precision at a stop, finger held up while she is driving, never more than 3 fingers at a time in the air on a single hand, etc.  How she multitasks says a lot about her.  And how young Michael notices or doesn't notice/register the movements etc. but still remembers (so current day Michael can use it to get back there to that moment) opens up a side bar (however short) about how memories are made and why do we hold on to certain ones.  Is it because those "define" our total memories of that person?  etc.

i like that we are digging in to the How of the time travel process and that M is experimenting.

Also, on the first person narrator.  Do we shift to 1st person Michael when he is in the past but 3rd person narrator when he comes back? ]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan kept glancing over his shoulder to see how Arthur was navigating the rocky pathway. The sound of the burbling water could be heard in between the crunching rocky footsteps. This is nice, I can see why Dr. Jonathan likes to have sessions out here. Bit of outward solace just may make me feel like Iâm not being squeezed and twisted Arthur thought. Jonathan paused and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. Arthur looked up to see aÂ  small creature scurry across the path. The rocky path was lined by trees with roots that crossed the path and sat just high enough to trip the casual hikers. Watch your step here Jonathan said traversing some oddly shaped boulders. Arthur peered into the doctors memory to help him traverse the boulder. I know I shouldnât, but I donât want to twist an ankle. Arthur saw hundreds of trips down the path, first three trips the doctor wore dark brown dress shoes and not his sneakers. Arthur felt soft shimmers pass down his body as he passed over a memory of a twisted ankle. Curiously he followed the events after the doctor fell, shades of embarrassment and pain colored the memory of the walk up the hill, one arm over a large woman who had tear streaked makeup. Arthur inhaled as his foot missed the Stoney step, he had gone too deep to remember he was still walking. Jonathan turned around as Arthur grabbed a tree branchÂ  burning his palm as he slid. Are you ok the Dr marched over. Yeah, just in my head, not looking where I was going. Well thatâs one nice thing about this little path, you got to be out of your head for a bit to navigate it. The doctor smiled and extended his hand to Arthur pulling him to his feet. A quick peak revealed similar memories of patients falling and the exact phrase about being out of your head for a bit. Stop Arthur thought to himself, that is twice, you told yourself you were done. Almost there, Jonathan said pointing to a large boulder extending into the meandering river. Why do you like to talk out her Jonathan? Jonathan insisted on being called Jonathan and not Doctor. Well it is a good place with great views and it is free from all sorts of stressors, private and a good excuse to get my steps in. The doctor stepped down onto the large flat rock and turned to extend a hand to Arthur. This is too romantic, I wonder if the good doctor has done more than counsel on this spot, maybe a quick check? No, stop, no more digging.Â  Arthur hopped down with the doctors help. The river was shallow and Arthur liked that. You know this is when I tell my patients who suffer from anxiety and guilt how I got my start in counseling. The doctors gaze met Arthurâs, his shoulders set back and chin thoughtfully elevated. I killed someone. The water leaping and crashing over and onto rocks filled the silence for several moments. I didn't mean to kill, but I did. And it is something that has profoundly shaped me Arthur. I am not happy it happened, but I am glad I get to help others with their guilt. What happened Arthur asked. It was a car accident, I was 16. Later than I should have been out. A small girl was unbuckled in the backseat of her mother's car. They were pulling out of a driveway on a blind curve. I was driving fast, I swerved to avoid the car and ended up off the road in a ditch. My cousin wasnât wearing a seat belt either and he went through the windshield. The woman thanked me for swerving, told me her daughter was in the backseat unbuckled as the ambulance took my unresponsive cousin to the hospital. Jonathan didnât look like he was telling a story he had told many times before. His eyes were damp and his voice shook. Arthur knew he was going to look, he relented and stared at the scene. It felt like rubbing his finger over a sharp blade. It hurt bringing up and putting it away. Arthurâs ears flushed and his heartbeat thumped in his ear. The doctor didnât mention the smell of radiator fluid boiling on the engine or the taste of metallic blood. His cousin didnât lay still either he twitched his left leg, almost like he was trying to run. The crushing reality dawned slowly as the hope that is was a bad dream faded and pain bloomed. His cousin, Erin had red curly hair and the paramedics tried brushing out the leafy debris without upsetting his crushed skull. A paramedic looked down at Erin on the stretcher and shook his head then looked up towards Jonathan and purses his lips in frustrated disapproval. That was the most clear and full bodied section. It was like the moment falling on your back having all the air knocked out of you and waiting for the next breath as the seconds dragged on. Arthur thought about taking that memory for Jonathan, but before he did Jonathan said. I know it is different than your guilt, and it is terrible, but it made me who I am today. I am glad I get to help people. Arthurâs eyes were damp and his expression was distant Jonathan put his hand on Arthurâs shoulder as a sign of shared sadness not realizing how truly shared the pain was.</span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So Arthur can take peopleâs memories from them?  Does it hurt?  Like is there pain for taker and takee?  Or maybe only the taker feels the pain.  Like debits and credits on a ledger.  

I wasnât sure if this was ASMC, Portrait or something new.  But itâs got a good feel for setting including the little references tossed in like roots just high enough to trip unwatchful hikers.  

As usual :) your stuff kicks off a chain thoughts and musings.  If (as James Tiberius Kirk says) we are the sum of our pain and we need it what does it mean when someone takes it from us?  Even if they think they are helping?  

Looking forward to seeing where this is coming from.  It is interesting that as I try to figure out if itâs from yours, ours or mine I see the parallels in each of the stories.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bess held Doyle's hand silently and counted seconds. It was like a hundred, maybe a thousand deja vus overlapping. She could feel Doyle's hand tightening ever so slowly.

He knows what Harry is about, she thought. A cavalier smile was plastered across Doyle's lips. He started to shoot her a confident wink then stopped. They had know each other too long. Instead he turned back to the stage and the giant metal contraption Harry was submerged in.

Bess felt a drop of water hit the back of her hand and looked up. They were near the front so it could have come from... Another drop. Bess scanned the audience around and behind her. A number of people were looking towards the rafters of the old theatre. They were feeling the drips as well.

"Doyle, there is--"

"Look!" He hissed. He yanked her hand roughly as he pointed at water filled metal structure. "Look! Look at it!"

The top where the seven locks were secured were rattling. "He can't get out!"

A drop hit Bess on her forehead and she looked up. Beside her she heard Doyle bellow and rush forward. She looked. He was climbing over seats and patrons not caring which got a boot or fist or knee.

"Open it!" He yelled to the girl on stage. He was struggling to get through the mass of confused bodies.

Another drop hit her. This time on her forearm. The theater's lights came on at the moment and she saw that the water wasn't water--it was dark red.

A woman screamed and then a man shouted as others noticed the same red staining their skin and clothes.

And Bess knew. Somehow she knew.

"Harry, no!"

She was moving before the words left her lips. Ahead of her Doyle was still scrambling but now the press of bodies was confounding his forward progress. Bess kicked off her shoes and began running over people. Other patrons screamed or cursed at her but she did not stop. In an instant she was past Doyle and then...

The orchestra pit! It was empty but deep in this old theater. Bess half fell, half dove across it. She knew she was not going to make it before her feet left the edge of the pit. Then she was falling and screaming.

A strong hand caught her arm yanking it painfully and stopping her fall. Bess looked up expecting to see Doyle but it was Harry's new stage assistant, the younger, blonder version of Bess. The woman grabbed Bess' arm with her free hand and began frantically backpedaling.

She is too weak to hold me, Bess thought. But the woman's terror apparently gave her strength. She strained, arching her back away from the pit and slowly pulled Bess onto the stage.

As soon as Bess's knees were on the woman let her go.

"There are too many keys," she yelled at Bess and thrust them forward into Bess's face. Bess grabbed them.

"I know," Bess said. She ran to lid checked the first lock. "132," she muttered, her hands flipping through the keys automatically. She found the right one and quickly unlocked it.

"They--" the woman started then stopped when she saw Bess was onto the 3rd lock. "How...?"

Bess talked as she worked. "Harry made me memorize the locks and their keys and backup keys. Good idea really. In case of something like this."

I am ranting, Bess thought. I need to--

The key to the 5th lock twisted and broke inside the lock. For a moment Bess stared at the mangled key in horrified fascination.

"Axe!" yelled a man behind her and she turned to see Doyle charging with a fire axe held above his head. She and Harry's assistant dove out of his way as he passed. He struck the lock and it and the head of the axe flew off and skidded across the stage. Doyle grabbed the metal container's lid and pulled.

Off stage, patrons were shouting at each other and clawing to get to the exits as the drops of red water <em>(blood, Bess realized)</em> became steady trickles around them.

"We have to get him out before the blood stops falling," she yelled to Doyle over the pandemonium.

"What?" he yelled back. He was still tugging on the top but it was stuck. Bess and the woman joined Doyle, straining against the stuck lid.

He is dead, she thought. Harry. No one could--

Another pair of hands, these enormous, grabbed the lid. It was Doyle's driver, Benson? Devin? Why am I so damn bad with names, she thought hysterically.

With a screech the lid ripped off. The two women and Doyle fell backwards onto the floor. Doyle's driver thrust a meaty arm inside the metal container and pulled out...

Not Harry! Bess's mind screamed at her. She climbed to her knees and scrambled forward on all fours.

"Who--"

Doyle's driver stared in shock at the small body in his arms. A small girl. A girl in a mud covered green dress, no not green, that it was white stained green by the mud and water, white with--

"Blue flowers," Bess whispered, horrified. She knew that dress. Had made it with her own hands.

How? Why? How had Harry...? Why had he..? Where...? What was...? Questions flashed through her mind in a jumble.

And Bess was falling somehow both backward and down into herself. The horror of that day so long ago, so buried...

Then the girl coughed and vomited a stream of murky black liquid. Mud, water....lake water, Bess thought.

Her eyes opened. "Mommie?"

Bess had the girl in her arms suddenly. She barely registered Doyle's driver's grunt as she elbowed him aside.

Her girl! Her Nell. Hers!

Tears streamed down Bess's face. If it was a dream...it was not a dream. Somehow Bess knew it. It was impossible but Nell was here. Alive.

"Mommie," the girl cried, clinging so hard to Bess that her arms were bruising under the tiny girl's grip. Bess covered her with kisses, tasting the foul mud and lake water and not caring.

"Here, baby," Bess cooed, stroking Nell's dirty hair. "Never let you go again."

"Gott in Himmel!" a voice yelled. Bess looked up to see Doyle and his driver dragging Harry out of the metal container. He was covered in--not mud--blood, Harry was covered in thick dark red blood. Dried blood.

She started to reach a hand out to him, but Nell clutched frantically and pulled Bess's arm back around her tiny body.

Harry was cursing and struggling as they dragged him out. Cursing in...it was not English.

Harry tried to swing a haymaker punch the two men. The driver ducked back in time but it caught Doyle square on the chin.

Harry cackled. "Still," he said in between guffaws, "slow. Still slow." Then he said something in that other language and collapsed onto the hardwood stage floor.

"Bloody bastard!" Doyle grunted. He ran a hand over his chin. "Go to Hell!"

Harry's eyelids fluttered open. He leered at Doyle. He sat up clutching Doyle by his lapels. He whispered something in a loud hiss then collapsed again. This time Doyle's driver caught him and lowered him carefully down. "'E'll be alright."

"I'll bring the car round, Mr. Doyle," he said quietly and climbed to his feet. He nodded to Bess, watched Nell for a moment then walked off into the wings.

Doyle stared down at Harry. He took out his handkerchief and dabbed carefully at Harry's face as if he was not sure where first to start cleaning off the blood. There was so much of it.

Doyle looked back at Bess, saw Nell in her arms and smiled.

"Stupid German bastard," he chuckled.

Bess had no idea of what he was talking about and realized she did not care. Doyle looked up sharply at where Dobbs had exited. He looked perplexed.

Harry groaned and stirred slightly.

"Harry?" Bess and Doyle said at the same time. Harry opens his eyes slowly and looked at the two of them then his eyes fell on Nell. He tried to sit up and failed. He settled for dragging himself by his arms and ignoring Doyle's outstretched hand.

He put a gentle hand on Nell's back. She sighed and hugged Bess tighter.

"Daddy," she whispered and leaned slightly backward, into his chest.

Then she craned her neck back to look at Doyle. "Where did the man go, Uncle Arthur?" She pronounced his name without the 't' sound. Like she always had.

"My German friend? He made it..." Doyle started, searching for the right words. He looked again where Dobbs had exited. "He made it home, I suppose."

"Good," the little girl said. "His face was scratchy but he was nice."

"Not nice, shortcake. But definitely good," Doyle responded.

The four of them sat in silence then for a long time. Each, even Nell, knew somehow that Dobbs and the car were never coming back. The German had a long way to go now.

The End]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dobs! I really appreciate the depth and variety of characters you have it is very apparent and they each feel unique and contributory to the story. I like the pacing of this piece, it is thrilling and I think we get a good since of the characters feelings for Harry and each other. The urgency really gives this an overall nice feel and solid composition. I know I was wondering if he was going to make and found myself reading faster to find out if he does. I think this is a satisfying ending. It arrives at a place with a strong visual and gives me a sense of a camera slowly zooming out. I think that it also raises questions which makes one think and stay a bit longer in this world to consider how the people move on from here. Doyle shines as usual, Bess is redeemed and portrayed as clever. Harry is heroic and crazy. Dobs gets this great moment of helping the team out and it feels right to have him there. I think that this could be a good place to land!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[T.J. was a bully.

Everyone knew it and everyone <em>tried</em> to stay out of his way.  But he was like this force of nature that you knew was there but never knew when it would strike.

Months would go by without an incident then T.J. would be walking down the hall, decide he did not like someone's face and they would find themselves slammed into a bank of lockers.

Any other kid in the school--in any school--would have been kicked out of school by then.  But T.J. was very big and very, very strong.  In football he basically was the offensive line, in basketball he just stood under the basket and pushed kids away from it.  There are no kings and queens in America, but never doubt the presence of royalty.  Sports stars, rock stars, movie stars all live by a different code and as long as T.J. kept the town in trophies a few students with bloody noses and bruises was just collateral damage.

"I know it is him," Michelle said, holding up a card that said "T.J."

Daniel, Rodney and Michelle were gathered around a pegboard.  Names and times had been written on 3x5 index cards.  Most were scattered across the desk, a few were up on the board.

Rodney ignored Michelle and gazed up at the board.

"Did you hear me, genius?" Michelle asked, poking Rodney.  He ignored her.

She poked Daniel in the shoulder. "Revenge of the Nerds, did you hear me?"

"Ouch!" He squeaked.  Daniel rubbed his arm.  "People can die from that, you know!  Blood clots happen all the time and it does not take much pressure to kill someone."

Michelle rolled her eyes.  She turned back to Rodney.  "Do you have anything to add?  You have been staring at that board for an hour.  Is this really what you guys do all day?"

"We do other stuff, too," Daniel said defensively.  He shot a furtive glance at the Clue game box wedged partially under the table in the back of the room.

"Whatever," Michelle sighed.  "Since Stoner Bob here is checked out maybe you can tell me why we are bothering with all this l, Danny Boy."  She flopped the card onto the table beneath the peg board.  "You are supposed to be helping me get proof that T.J. killed Sarah."

"Actually we are trying to figure out who did it, Michelle," Rodney said.  "You asked us to do that."

Rodney turned to her.  "People think I don't pay attention but I--wait I thought you said something about snacks."

"Yeah, I lied," Michelle said.  "So back to T.J. How can we prove he did it."

"We need to establish a pattern of behavior," Daniel said.  "Rule out his alibis, find the murder weapon, location of the crime."

"Are you reading this off the back of a Clue game box or something?" Michelle asked.  "I know all of that.  That is cop show 101.  What are you going to do?"  Michelle asked, enunciating her last three words.

"Okay, maybe let's start with an alibi," Daniel said.  "We can rule out any alibis like staying with a friend or stuff like that.  Then when we--um, to that point, we're, um, we planning on confronting T.J.?  Like by ourselves?"

"I don't want to die," Rodney said.

Michelle threw up her hands in frustration.  "I wouldn't expect a couple of dorks who sit around playing board games--yes I can see the Clue box you are trying not to look at, Daniel.  I wouldn't expect you dorks to do the hero stuff.  Just get proof so I can make the cops listen."

"Sounds like a good idea to me," said a voice behind them.  They turned to find T.J. standing in the doorway.  He took a step into the room...and kicked over a desk.  It slammed into the wall.  Everyone including T.J. Stared at it.

"Oh..." said Daniel.

"...crap," finished Rodney.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is great groundwork for the foundation. I also like Michelle's assertion that TJ did it, the back and forth avoids exposition but lays the rails for the plot. 
I like Dan's comment on blood clots, gives us some idea as to his anxiety. I also like the hints that Rodney is super focused but it looks like tuning out. That gives us some great character definition. I am looking forward to some conflict betweeb TJ and Michelle and possibly some romance with Dan :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought that ensnares the brain is things gone are really truly gone. I don't like the thought or the thoughts around it but it keeps pulling me back like it is some kind of thing I am supposed to think about. It feels like a responsibility, I don't know what to do with it and I want it to go away. I didn't think about how nice control felt, the hellos and goodbyes as certain as the past. Now, this idea keeps washing over me that it is once again locked behind some door I cannot open. I feel things moving forward and it doesn't feel like progress, it feels like leaving home.

Michael lay on the bed dutifully considering his impact. Ellory's mother sent Michael a box of stuff with some memento's she thought he would like. Michael reached for the drawer and pulled out a small pocket knife and cut the tape and pulled out a furry collar with a faded copper plate, it was Biscuits, Ellory's first dog. Michael remembered Eleanor saying Biscuit liked him the most out of all the family members, Ellory didn't like that. She pulled biscuit by the collar out of the room. "There NOW we can play" She said staunchly. Michael lifted the collar to his nose and for a brief moment he could hear the dog pawing at the playroom door and see a plastic pink tea cup. Michael sat up straight and closed his eyes to think. The neural complacency equation must have been wrong, he may yet have a small window. I don't have to say goodbye at the funeral! Damn that tradition I can say goodbye when I like. The equation couldn't be off by that much, he must have desynchronized with moments left. The moments passed like a heavy flow of water, Michael's eyes shot from one side to another. Every second here was one less there. No time for planning, the most immediate anchor would have to do. Michael connected wires to the machine plugged it into the wall and opened his window to run an extra two extension cord to a service building outside. It is going to work.

I know it will, I just have to get there quickly. This may not be safe and could send anyone in earshot to a time they felt conflicted and embarrassed but here it goes.

The room rumbled in a deep roar and the lights dimmed and flickered. I better make this count Michael thought.

"Hey are you listening to me mister?" Ellory came into a blurry focus with her hand on her hip. "You are getting on my nerves!" She stamped her foot for emphasis. "Hey you are really great you know that and I really appreciate the time..." Michael said earnestly before being interrupted with "Ahhh talk to the hand cause the face is too busy." Michael gathered they were playing house but wasn't sure who he was or what he had done. A stern and unemotional voice yelled from the other room behind the door and was met with a meek tearful reply. "Shhh she has a friend over Frank!" Elanor said in a loud whisper. "Shut up!" Glass shattered then footsteps slammed down hard then a door slammed. Ellory's faced flushed red and she yelled "You can't do anything right!" pointing at Michael. He started to say I am sorry but stopped. Michael stepped forward and Ellory slapped his face hard. She glared through him as her eyes welled and nose ran. Michael stepped forward again and held her close. She took shallow breaths between tears. Michael didn't say anything. Moments passed. His vision tunneled. I'm here for you he whispered.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Iâm lost in the first part.  We can cover it in the podcast this week :). So I like the moments here takes away from moments there section.  It adds tension because we see Michael doesnât have a blank check time travel card.   Also like the little reference to if someone else was standing near by they would be transported into their own past.  I like that there is an area effect to the science/âmagicâ (?).  

Really good emotional stuff at the end there.  Glass breaking is good because we donât need to hear much to know the severity of what is happening in the other room.  Good serve up with the motherâs whispered comment then slam it with the glass breaking.  Nice!

I also like Elloryâs role-playing the emotions she feels through the medium of what she must have seen in the past at some point.  Maybe many times.  Good stuff.  I like the way MICHAEL has to scramble to figure out where he is while staying in âcharacterâ of the moment.

You still owe 50 burpees :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Dan I don't think there is gonna be anything helpful in town hall." Rodney said strolling next to his friend. Dan ducked beneath the holly bushes. "Shh! Come this way. Listen I think we should at least check it out. I don't think secret messages and Sarah's disappearance are just, ya know, coincidence. Plus all you want to do is sit outside TJ's place, I can't take anymore of that! He is the least interesting person to watch." Dan said crawling through a thin maze of pointy bushes. "That guy is guilty!" Rodney said in a hushed voice and followed through the bushes holding up a green lighter. "So you think he abducted her AND wants to help with the investigation?" Dan remarked and turned to stop in a small clearing of underbrush. "He is a nut! He doesn't think we are smart enough to catch him. He thinks he can just say some things and we will stop being suspicious. Well little does he know no evidence could stop me believin he did it!" Rodney raved in a quiet but biting voice. Dan rolled his eyes. "Well we are here now lets just take a look around. It's up ahead there is a basement window." Dan pointed towards a brushy rabbit trail concealed beneath the tall bushes. "Ok, hear me out. No one else is up in arms about this. The police, even your Dad isn't doing nothin but puttin up posters. My theory is that they know TJ done it and they are protecting him cause he is the star player for the Lumberjacks." Rodney poked his palm with his pointer finger to punctuate his theory. "Rodney, Hank Starr is Sarah's Uncle, no way would he put TJ before his family. Plus he is one of the good ones, my dad said he believes in duty and all that." Dan raised his eyebrows. Rodney raised a finger to fire back, but didn't. "C'mon" Dan said starting to crawl to the window. The small pen light bounced off of the grimy glass of the low cellar window. "Is there anything Hank is into that someone could be blackmailing him for?" Rodney sounded earnest trying to make the world fit into his story. "Rodney! No, if the theory doesn't fit the facts you have to change the theory, that's science. That is what Mr. S always says when we guess wrong in the weekly murder scenario." Dan turned the flashlight towards his friend and gave him sharp look. "I still think he did it." Rodney said obstinately. The two pulled on the wood window frame which slowly lifted a few inches above the dirt. Dan shined the flashlight into the dark basement. "Ya know that message 'Town hall says suppress all information about the girl', may not refer to the actual, well town hall." Rodney's voice cracked as he peered into the still black room of the old building. "I'm going in, I got a feeling we have to." Dan confidently slid head first into the gloom. He would never let me forget it, Rodney thought as he reluctantly crawled through the small opening.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really Like the development of Rodneyâs character in here. A lot of those little things paint a great picture like the raising the finger but having nothing to come back with as a retard. I also like the riding around that âfired backâ.  The indirect metaphor choice underscores the conflict both internal got Rodney as he struggles to force facts into a theory and between Dan and Rodney about how to move forward.

Also funny with the âmaybe town hall didnât actually mean the town hallâ bit.  Nice word choice too because âCity Hallâ carries the designation of the Mayor etc from countless movies so Town Hall gives it that âcorruption at the center of the web of liesâ feel but pushes it almost ironically into small potato politics with the âtownâ.  It does well with the dichotomy we are trying to produce in the piece:  middle of nowhere, who-cares town but with events of importance to the people living in that town.  Like Garrison Keillorâs Lake Woebegone stuff.  Tiny little characters of seeming insignificance but once you dig a little you find the insignificant to be drawing you in.

I think it would be funny too if something in the posters was wrong also.  Like some subtle thing where they misspelled her name or something.  And it drives Rodney crazy consciously because itâs  something so trivial but how could the police in Sarahâs OWN town not care enough to look up the proper spelling.  And subconsciously it bothers Rodney because he knows deep down something or someone is subtly trying to brush it under the rug.  I.e., if the town center Demi-god can get the misspelling to take/catch on he has erased a little more of Sarah and people move on that much quicker with their lives and forget about her or relegate her to a historical but mostly forgotten event.

I also like the mention of Mr S.  It begs the question of why are they not involving him.  If they are worried it could be a conspiracy then not telling him makes it even more sinister and gives it a Grasshopper vs. the master feeling.  :). Every great coming of age book needs a foil in the form of the Old Guard to the younger main character(s) New Way of Doing Things.  Basically the plot of every âheroic but rogueâ cop movie ever...

Also canât wait to see what they are referring to with what TJ said.  Was it at his house?  Did he catch them?  Or was it at the ASMC classroom / headquarters?  When TJ inadvertently looked like he was threatening them when he was knocking stuff over?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harry was still under the water. She could see him through the glass struggling, really struggling. Everyone in the audience could see him. A few nervous laughs came from the gallery patrons but mostly people just sat staring, transfixed.

Like an execution, Bess thought.

"Bread and bloody circuses," Doyle muttered, echoing her thoughts. She did not think the pun was intentional. Doyle always swore when he was scared. Or angry. Or awake.

In the tank, Harry's movements became more frantic...

Harry looked around. He was soaking wet but no longer underwater. He was in a some sort of a stone room, no, it was a cave. There was movement off to Harry's left. Someone was gesturing.

"The German!" Harry said. "What are you--where am I?"

The man gestured more frantically for Harry to follow him. Harry took a tentative set towards the German then another. When he was close the German put out a hand. Harry noticed that it was blood stained and arms he peered closer in the dim light he realized the man was in full dress uniform and it was filthy and also blood stained.

Harry took the man's hand. The German closed breathed almost in a reluctant sigh and then the cave was gone and the world was chaos.

The man yanked Harry to the ground and pulled him behind some twisted metal pylons. Bullets ricocheted all around them. Explosions rocked the earth and all around them men tore at each other with swords and bayonet and pikes. Ten yards away a man in an ancient looking uniform fired a pistol into an enemy's face. Blood and brains splattered but a second later both men were run through with a long pike.

Harry watched in horror as the two looked down in unison then began pushing themselves off either end of the pipe.

"No die," the German said. "No die here ever. Just pain." He pulled Harry along a thin line of cover towards another opening in the ground.

The two fell into it right as a mortar went off above their heads. Bits of rock punched miniature holes in Harry's skin. He might have screamed but he could not distinguish his own from the screams and cries of pain around him.

The German pulled him deeper into the cave.

"What is this place!?!" Harry yelled over the din of battle above them.

"No lower Heaven, raise Hell," the German yelled back.

"Come you to her. Now!"

"My daughter?" Harry asked as the raced into the darkness. "She is here in THIS place?"

The man stopped abruptly and peered into Harry's eyes.

"I bring girl here," he said after a minute and turned back to the path, running now. "Only way. You take her back out." The man suddenly stopped and spun around. "You stay. You!" He poked a rough finger into Harry's chest. "Here," he waived a hand around, as if indicating the whole world. "In the place, she go to back out."

Harry considered for a moment. Then he thought of Bess and nodded his head. "Just take me to her."

Doyle's fist clenched and unclenched uncontrollably.

"Too long, too damn long," he said.

Harry's struggling had slowed in the glassed-in cage full of water. He was still moving though. How long could he hold his breath?

"I am going up there," Bess said. "Excuse me," she said trying to edge past the patron standing to her left. The seating rows and aisles were crowded as people moved closer or crained their necks to get a better view of the spectacle--magician dies in his signature trick. I was there!

"Excuse me," she said again pushed more firmly. Beside Bess's left ear a fist went flying by and crunched into the patron's jaw. The man went down instantly.

Then Doyle was in front of her tossing punches and shoving people out of his way. He was a bull in a rage and he tore mercilessly through the crowd of gawkers. Bess rushed to keep up not caring now who she stepped on.

"Harry," she yelled in the direction of the stage.

"Fire!" screamed Doyle. That broke the spell. The entire theater erupted in chaos as people streamed towards the exits, clawing and climbing over each other in their frantic flight.

Doyle was momentarily pushed back in the crush but Bess found it somehow easier to swim through the mass of bodies because of her smaller stature.

She made it to the stage and scrambled onto it. Harry's new assistant was banging on the side of the glass now. And she was holding the keys.

"The keys," Bess screamed. The girl ignored her and kept banging on the glass. Bess shoved her aside and grabbed the keys from her hand. She had memorized these keys and their locks, knew them each by touch after hours spent memorizing their every facet.

Bess pushed the first key into the lock and twisted. She forced herself to calm down. She worked by rote, opening the locks in reverse sequence.

Doyle was beside her, his hands pressed to the glass. "He is still alive."

Bess nodded. "Four minutes I think," she said. "He told me that once. Or maybe 40 minutes. Fourteen?"

She knew she was distracting herself, making this just another rehearsal.

Then the new assistant screamed. She pointed inside the glass. Bess looked up and dropped the keys. There was a small girl in the water with Harry. But she was not moving.

Harry stared out of the glass at Doyle and Bess. He opened his mouth to speak but his voice sounded strange. A hand struck him across the cheek. It was the German.

"Close mouth! Die if to do!" He shouted in Harry's face.

I am looking out of my own eyes, he thought. It was like looking through a tunnel. Then he eyes in his body in the tank looked down. Harry--both Harrys--saw what he was holding: a small girl. Then all Hell broke loose.

The earth above Harry was ripped away, revealing a blood red sky. Men and some women poured into through the gap above them. The German cursed and began kicking and punching and stabbing. Harry realized with horror and relief that the combatants were not coming for him specifically; the eternal War was just spilling over into their temporary refuge.

"Go her now! Her out! Go! Go!" The German yelled over the screams and howls of the enemy. He pointed down the pair of tunnels leading out of Harry's eyes and into the world of the living. Harry grabbed his daughter and, shielding her as best as he could, charged forward towards the murky vision in front of him.

Doyle and Bess both saw into Harry's eyes but they saw different things. Through Harry's pupils Bess could see another Harry running toward them somehow. He was carrying something. Doyle saw the German and the War raging around him. He saw all of the horror of the trenches behind the Harry running towards him.

"I don't--" Bess said but she was focused on Harry and what they could both see now was a girl Harry was carrying.

Something grabbed at Harry's shoulder and the Harry in the tank swayed backwards. The fight was starting to engulf Harry.

"God! He is not going to make it," Doyle said.

"Run, Harry!" Bess yelled, shoving her face into the glass. "Please!"

Doyle had seen war, had seen battle. He had done horrible things, seen them, and he knew Harry would not be able to outrun the War. No one could.

Then he saw something, someone in the fray behind Harry. For a moment the German's eyes locked with Doyle's. Everything slowed. The German smiled a wicked, challenging smile. Doyle made his decision.

Harry knew he was not going to make it. Something had his shoulder and now it had his leg. He screamed and pushed forward with all his might. Then he felt his daughter slip and he dove forward frantically reaching for her.

Something slammed into Harry--no, through him. Everything went dark and he waved his hands in the darkness, searching for his daughter.

For one brief moment it was all clear. Then Bess was choking, water streamed into her mouth. Everything around her was dark and murky. Slimy things grabbed at her ankles.

He was there suddenly. His arms around her and he pressed his lips to hers. He forced air into her lungs. She struggled willing him to stop, knowing instinctively what he was doing, but he was stronger than her, even now. He gripped her around her waist, set his feet and heaved upwards. Bess felt whatever had her legs rip off violently then she was floating upward. She reached for him but he only smiled and shifted his gaze to her left.

An arm snaked around her waist and yanked her upwards into the light. As she broke the surface of the water, sweet air flooded into her lungs.

"Mommie!" she yelled--

Bess stumbled and fell to her knees. Her fingers gripped...sand? "Mommie!" yelled...her daughter. And then she was there in Bess's arms.

Harry crawled onto the beach and sucked in a breath. "Doyle!" he panted.

"What?" Bess said. She hugged her daughter.

"Doyle went in after her!" Harry said. He stood up and looked around. "Where is he?!?"

Bess sat back heavily. "Doyle? He isn't here--Doyle?"

"Yes!" Harry said. "He went in after her," he gestured at their daughter. "Right before me."

Harry splashed into the water. "Doyle!" he screamed. He dove under the dark lake water and popped up a few feet away and dove back down again.

Bess looked down at her daughter and squeezed her into a hug. Something was off. Something felt wrong. Her daughter looked up and Bess saw it all in her eyes. Her older, haggard looking self outside of the glass, Doyle, older too, standing beside her. Both looking back at her. Old Doyle and her older self looked at each other and Bess saw a tenderness there that ripped at her heart.

From the lake, Harry screamed again for Doyle and dove under.

Older Doyle, on the other side of the glass disappeared, then she saw him standing in a sea of bodies and carnage. Hands reached up, dragging him down. Then he was back atop the pile, swinging some sharp weapon. He was covered in blood and had a wild look in his eyes. His locked on hers and he--he smiled.

"Glad I skipped the horses races," she heard in her head. Then her daughter blinked and the vision was gone.

Doyle climbed over the body he had just finished smashing to a pulp and looked up into the twilight.

"Is this where I think it is?" Doyle asked the man who had come up to stand beside him.

"Yes, no," the German said. "Come. Be morning soon. We rest."

Doyle pursed his lips. He was bleeding from a dozen wounds and part of his left arm below the elbow was missing. He held up the stump and frowned at it.

"Come," the German said. "I fight you with one hand back." He let out a cackle then slapped Doyle on the back.

"Not you here. Not right. Magician. For here," the German said. He had sat down on a small pile of clear ground and was patting his shirt looking for a pack of cigarettes.

"I am aware of that," Doyle said curtly. "Maybe I just like your company, you filthy Kraut."

"Maybe," the German laughed.

In spite of the pain, Doyle smiled too. He thought of the three of them: Bess and her daughter with their matching bright blue eyes and Harry, dark eyed and swarthy, his arms draped around them. Smiling. That memory had not been made at the lake, it had come from a few months before. But it was Doyle's memory and he clutched it close to his heart: the three things he loved most in this--in that--in any world.

"Come on, Blue Eyes," the German said to Doyle. "We find place to rest. Put picture away for tonight."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Woah, a darker but perhaps more revealing finale! It was a wild ride from panic to concern to following the characters through time. I thought it really shined well for Doyle, I think he is my favorite. One thing I thought about alot especially at the end was the namelessness of the German he has this big part in the end and is nameless. I like this direction, it is a far way to travel in one bit. I wonder if perhaps there should be some build up to the time travel, maybe more mysterious unexplained things with vesla or maybe they meet another famous 19th century figure or some one from another time. For all the period piece world building some of my favorite things are the world building and the buddy cop vibe! I like the ending, loads of questions, one of which is do we still get Sherlock if Doyle dies? haha. Does Harry remember the whole build up to this that saved his daughter?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The air was musty and still and the sound of Rodneyâs fall was muffled and short. Lines of silver white moon light moved around the dark floor as the wind blew the bushes overhead.Â  Ouch Rodney muttered dusting himself off. âWow, look at this place, its like old, really old.â Dan said pointing his flashlight at a row of theatre seats covered in cobwebs and sawdust. âGet a load of thisâÂ  Rodney whispered holding up a large wooden box with bellows and open circle. âItâs a camera, it looks like friggen canon.â Rodney feigned shooting his friend with the contraption. âOk, very funny put that down.â Dan said gesturing with his flashlight. âWe need to find evidence, se we gotta get into the offices.â Dan scanned the basement looking over tables and file cabinets sleepily lying covered in stillness and grime.Â  Danâs light passed over an oblong door that was slightly open. Dan started moving towards the door, the deepness of the dark growing with each hushed creaking step. The door seemed to grow ominously larger and the sound was arrested more quickly as Dan drew near. Hear reached out his arm, then paused, thought of Michelle and how grateful she would be if he found some evidence. He would get to second base for sure, which to Dan was french kissing. Dan turned towards Rodney who was flailing his arms quietly but desperately try to get Danâs attention. Rodney pointed towards the corner of the room next to the window. It was a bed and in it was a silent snoozing short man in a white undershirt. Rodney eyes wide made a slashing motion on his throat and held a stiff finger to his nose. SHHHH hey quietly mimed. Dan turned and reached for the door, lifting the knob slowly as he pulled so as to not make noise while sliding the door open. Rodney slid swiftly towards him checking over his shoulder at the bed in the corner. Go he whispered and Dan stepped through the dark door frame into hallway of unknown length. Rodney pulled the large door gingerly turning the knob to avoid any contact with the frame. âDan, what the hell!â Rodney shouted in a near silent whisper. âWhat! How could I have known someone was sleeping in the basementâ Dan rose up on his toes to get at eye level with Rodney. âCâmon we can get out the front door. We just gotta get up the stairs.â Dan turned down the hallway pointing his light in front of him. âWhat tha?â Dan said squinting, the hallway seemed to stretch on for at least seventy five yards. The sides of the hall were light wooden panels with and small award placards and every four feet was a door on either side. âGuess we gotta try em allâ Dan said.</span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You b@stard!  I saw your comments on Clue come through right as I decided to fartsack my talkback duties for the evening and just do the burpees tomorrow.  Well, played, Mr. Chips!

So...I like the 2nd base line.  Does he know what 2nd bass really is?  Actually does anyone?  Home plate is covered and universal but what about the other bases?  There might be a few more little things you can squeeze out of that.  Maybe in the next section where they are trying all the doors because what else would you talk about.  âWait wait wait!  Under the shirt is 1st base?  Where does French kissing come in?  Is this Australian rules baseball or something?â

Actually that long walk down the hall has tons of potential.

Iâm curious about who the guy in the bed is.  Maybe one of the bureaucracy fairies (elves?).  Like they normally sleep inside trees or...since this is the modern day 1980s...in reams of paper.   But the Demi-Godâs weird magic is having subtle unexpected effects.  Bureaucracy fairies find themselves indulging in some very human behaviors like sleeping in a bedânot inside the railing or headboard like a proper fairy but actually on the surface like a human!

Is the camera an Easter egg for Harryâs camera. ð  I read that twice and was like wait a minute that sounds like...  

Youâve built a lot of sights sounds and Smells into this section and I like that.  I think memory is rooted in the latter two and I would get imagination is somehow too.  So the more that is layered in carefully the more real the world becomes.  

So does dan like Michelle or is it like a target of opportunity thing?  Sheâs a girl and she knows his name which to a teenage boy is practically a flashing red sign that says âthrow your heart at meâ.  

Good piece and the sleeping guy opens up a great complication to play with later on.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["T.J.," Daniel said, his voice cracking slightly.  "What's up, homie?"  As soon as the words left his mouth Daniel regretted them.  He felt Michelle's disapproving stare boring into the back of his skull.

"You tell me, home slice."  T.J. over-enunciated the moniker.  He stepped further into the room and slammed the door.  Daniel felt his throat go dry as he heard the lock click into place.

T.J. turned around slowly, almost cautiously.  He gave the overturned furniture a sidelong glance then continued.  "Word on the street is 2nd Place here is trying to frame me for Sarah's disappearance."

"2nd Place?" Rodney asked, looking at Michelle.Michelle scowled.  "He means 2nd to Sarah--"

"In everything!" T.J. said.  "Brains, cheerleading, hotness.  Everything."

"So you think she's hot?" Rodney asked, nodding toward Michelle.

"What?  No way!" T.J. protested.  "You twisted my words around."

"That is actually what you said," Michelle said.  She smirked viciously.  "Almost word for word."

Daniel nodded then realized what he was doing and scratched his ear to try to hide it.

T.J. made a fist.  "Keep it up, homeboy.  Let me make this real simple to all of you."  He shook his fist at Rodney.  "Especially you."

"I had nothing to do with Sarah disappearing.  We aren't even together any more."

"What!?!" Daniel said.  "Since when?"

"Since your momma," T.J. said.  "Since I caught her--just were not dating.  So I didn't kill her."  He looked around the room.  "Understand?"

"So like broken up permanently or taking a break?" Daniel asked.

Michelle sighed dramatically.  "Did she <strong>know that</strong> ?"

T.J. Shrugged.  "Did you, 2nd?"

"When was this?" Rodney asked.  "Never mind.  Do <strong>you</strong> <strong>have</strong> an alibi?"

"<strong>For what</strong>?  The last week?" T.J. Asked <strong>incredulously</strong>.  "I was at school and <strong>football</strong> <strong>practice</strong>.  Coach <strong>will</strong> vouch <strong>for</strong> me."

"You could <strong>have</strong> done it!"  Michelle <strong>said</strong>, her hands <strong>were balling</strong> into fists.  "The whole team would <strong>lie for</strong> <strong>you</strong>.  And half the <strong>people in</strong> <strong>this town</strong>."

"Maybe," T.J. said.  "Maybe not.  But for now--" he unlocked the door and opened it.  "Just go back to your dragons and dungeons."

T.J. left and closed the door behind him with only a mild slam.  The room was silent.

"So now we..." Rodney trailed off.  "He always surprises me with how big he is when I see him in person."

"Do you think it is a permanent break up?" Daniel asked no one in particular.  "She must be devastated."  He sat down heavily in his chair.

"Calm down, Romeo," Michelle said.  "We have to find her first before you propose."  When she saw Daniel's eyes light up she continued.  "Assuming she wanted to date the poster boy for lack of Wheaties."

"But he did it. Practically said it right there."

"I don't--" Rodney started.

"He has a manufactured alibi and a broken heart.  You need me to draw you a picture, Sherlock?" Michelle asked Rodney who blushed slightly and turned away.

"Broken up," Daniel mused. "That is great news."

"I am so screwed," Michelle said.  She turned to go.  "Just get some evidence on him.  I'll be in touch."  She left.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Haha. What a delightful scene. I cannot get over how much I like your dialogue, I get a real three dimesional person coming off the page when I read it. I like how Rodney is starting to piece things together, I think it works really well and if I didnât know he was secretly clever I would have that breadcrumb of hmm maybe Rodney is right. I like this version of TJ, I think he sounds stand offish enough to be suspicious. 

Ok question who does Dan like? I though he liked Michelle and Rodney didnât like that because he hates Michelle? 

I think the Alibi of TJ could give us some direction, like it is the first places Dan and Rodney go to double check and start finding out all the weird stuff. 

I like the second thing, and the Rodney calling him out on it, I think maybe we could have him be sarcastic and ask if he called her hot. 

I like the image of Dan just standing there shocked and frozen trying to figure out what to say and then immediately thinking shit, why canât I speak good! I think it shows some of his short comings which is fun, because too often written characters say things too well. 

Yes that was an allusion to a particular camera ð in my writing last week]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Night has always fascinated man. Perhaps it is the lack of light to illuminate things that makes the night feel mysterious. Or it could be that most people choose to sleep through the times of darkness and thus never get a feel for them they way they feel the light times. Maybe ancient man chose to hide in caves to avoid nocturnal predators and the feeling of exposure and uncertainty associated with the darkness has lingered. No matter the true cause for the feelings night brings, persons often find those feelings validated by unsavory characters who prefer night for itâs defining characteristic concealment.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For John night brought relief, a time to himself to reflect and get lost in ideaâs not present in his professional life. He would sit out on the porch of his apartment facing the tall trees and smoke cheap cigars by the light of copper string bulbs. After two shots of spiced rum from a well used shot glass John would start to think about some alternate world. A world of night illuminated by yellowed bulbs and silver blue moonlight accompanied by brassy instruments echoing far away. Cities swept with warm winds where mysterious business awaited John on lonely visages where the only people were tucked away in bars and cafes gossiping about criminal activity.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On this particular Thursday, John waited for his mind to drift off to lands of intrigue carried by his imagination. But he was firmly anchored by the business looming ahead of him. No amount of spiced rum could make him forget his court appointment racing towards him. John never liked courthouses, too much evidence of cruelty and inequality for him to dream in their. The picture he got in courthouses was one of bluntly painted laziness spurred by mounds of entrenched incrementalism. He felt like a foreigner in the courtroom, his tanned skin burned in his clothes almost as if some quantity of guilt was stained on it. It didnât help that called him Juan instead of John.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was getting late, all but one other apartment was dark. John didnât want to go to sleep because that would mean he was that much closer to the hearing. Family court is a weird place and it is humbling to walk amongst rough looking individuals with similar business. His son was turning five in a month and he knows there is a pretty good chance John wonât get to be there and it is all he can think about. The presents were all wrapped and waiting in the car, the only thing left was to sign the card. He didnât want to, the next birthday card would be a whole year away and by that time he would be only a memory. It felt like Sam was already fading away and becoming someone else.</span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow that is tough.  Real gut punch, nut kicker!  I was totally wrapped up in Johnâs character unfolding through description of his dreams (?).  Didnât see the Sam part and gone in a year coming.  Got me hook line and sinker there.  Good work.

Good choice to start with the musings on night and then pivot into the character actually musing in the dark.  What do we chose to day dream about informs heavily on us.  Excellent descriptions: brassy music etc.

 Lot of good meat in the story.  Why does John know so much about court houses as to have formed an opinion of them, a dislike of them.  I was thinking (and still entertaining) John being a lawyer. The kind that settles out of court mostly.  That is how I it blind sided on the family court.  I kept thinking it would be one of his clients.  Like I said a real unexpected nut kicker ð

Also excellent line on courts (one with incrementalism in the sentence).  You do a good job of sneaking those deep thought lines in.

Curious to see where this goes next (and what the hell story this is ð¤£)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael rubbed his eyes and looked up at the ceiling. He had already begun to rehearse the day in his head. First feet on the floor and navigate the path to the bathroom. Second, take a leak. Third grab jeans and his red- no green shirt. Fourth borrow some of Wood's mechanical pencils with erasers from his desk drawer. Fifth head to the cafeteria. Michael arose and began sleepily walking through these steps. Wood only had one mechanical pencil so Michael decided to stick with his chewed pen. The hall was busy, people coming back from early morning classes and people striding quickly to their next appointments.

Look down and forward, less likely people will stop you with a salutation or worse a question, Michael thought. This was a energetically viable way to process and navigate relationships, Michael rationalized. This was something he had been pondering and was working to encapsulate succinctly so that he could communicate some relationships advise to Ellory. She was really having a tough go of it in seventh grade and she seems to be working really hard to make everyone around her happy. The sum of the advise so far was a meager "Don't worry about people focus on what makes you happy." It lacked precision and generally felt like it was baked but it was a good start. Part of Micheal's hesitance to give this advise is that what Ellory liked at that time was theatre, and really she just liked having people to hang out with. Michael opened the door and descended the steps of the old brick building. It was beautiful day and Michael considered marking with some staining sensory experience, he grabbed the handrail warm from the morning sun and pulled air in through his nose.

"Screw anyone who gets in the way of you happiness!" Michael murmured to himself. Ahh, it didn't feel right. Mccalister probably has an excellent quote for this but I don't want someone elses words. Authors can piece together sticky notions that feel like textured thoughts, but what if she knew the origin of the advice? Michael knew Ellory would say "That's from so and so, I already know what they said." In doing so she would deflate the advise. I really want to give good advise, the idea rolled around Michael brain like a bowling ball. With the right combination of words I can make her happy.

Large oak trees held clumps of spanish moss appearing both artificially picturesque and wildly pristine overhead as Michael walked past the old chapel towards the cafeteria. Michael imagined a world were he said some combination of things that made Ellory smile and made her see the bright side of things. She tried out for lead roles, she didn't stay home from prom and she walked standing up tall. He smiled thinking about her dancing on the gymnasium floor for prom. If only I could tell her to wish someone else a great life and really picture it, that could work, Michael thought. No I think I like "Don't worry about people focus on what makes you happy." I think she may take to that one best.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good work!  You have really embraced the world building interwoven with character development.  All of the âwalk throughâ his morning stuff does double duty which is the ideal because the more layers in a sentence the less chance you have to write multiple to do the same thing.

I didnât understand the 7th grade reference because it seemed like he was in college and waking up in a dorm.  Is woody a roommate or brother?

I like the pencil interaction.  Finding only one and leaving it speaks to his character.  Itâs okay to take when there is extra but not when there is only one left.  It does make sense with his slightly grey area decisions to go into the past with knowledge from the present.

I still think timeline or setting the time at the beginning is important because of all the jumping around in time.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why he hated the girl with the acerbic wit was unfathomable. But if the god really thought hard about it two reasons seemed to bubble up from the depths of his memory.

Years ago? Was it years or decades? Or even...? No humans did not live for centuries so it must be a millennia. Yes, the god thought, five millennia ago the girl was at his worship stone. She--years! Years! Why do they break their time streams into so many parts, the god cursed.

The girl, she was years younger, five years. Out in the hour when the veil between the Walls was thinner. Human children did not travel in this hour much so she caught his attention. Also, there was no one else around awake for miles. When had the humans stopped living close to his worship stone? Uncle Samhain's ascendancy? So many came back broken then and they moved their families to the edge of his influence and jurisdiction. "Sub-herds" the humans called the new enclaves where they clustered away from his worship stone.

The girl! The god struggled to hold the thread of that particular painful memory. The humans moved out from his stone and into little sun-herds. The girl was from a sub-herd near the edge of his domain. She was out of her hers dwelling...

Michelle kicked a stone on the sidewalk. It was slightly out of her path so she changed direction to make it "in her way". It felt pointless but then the entire night was pointless. Pointless existence in a pointless town with pointless sidewalks and a pointless stupid statue in the central garden of the town.

Michelle followed the stone and gave it another kick. It rolled a few feet. Kick, roll, follow, kick, roll, follow. Kick--!

Physics is a comforting thing. If you kick a rock 100 times it will go forward from your foot. It will generally go the same distance each time. But sometimes Physics is downright nasty. Why that kick was the one neither the god (though he had his suspicions) and Michelle never knew. But the rock went flying in a perfect arc across the lawn, through the wrought iron fence and directly into the nose of the God's statue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The rock traveled through the air. Michelle watched with a mixture of horror and fascination as it sailed towards the ugly statue in the center of town. The god watched with horror as it came flying toward him.

Crack!

Three things happened at once in slow motion.

First, Michelle and the god both watched as the long protruding nose on the gods statue shifted hard to the left, dangled and this slowly sank to the ground and bounced three times.

Second, Michelle and the god both cursed. Neither heard the other but both would have admired the other's effort. The god had hundreds of years of listening to human cursing to draw from. Michelle had less institutional knowledge but more than made up for it with spot on word choices and creative ways of stringing those words together until the curse became almost a living thing it the target's mind. (Ironically both chose a goat theme for the base structure of their curse.)

Third, both stared stupefied at the broken stone nose on the cobble stones surrounding the statue. The god knew that should never be able to happen. Worship stones were constructed on another plane and only reflections in this world of the humans. It was where a god or goddess could kick their feet up at the end of a century and let fall away the cares of the mundane world. Had the girl kicked the stone through the Wall?

Michelle knew that she was screwed six ways to Sunday. There were very few unwritten rules in the town for juvenile delinquents: Don't set fire to the Christmas floats. Failing to return a library book gave the local librarians carte blanche to beat you down behind the library. Things like that. Those rules had some gray areas. If the Christmas float was from the next town over then people would snicker and look the other way. If the book you had out had some naked pictures in it then the volunteer book shelver, Mrs. Simpkins, would take it off your hands and return it within a few days to the shelves. All you had to do was complain that you had turned it in already and voila! home free.

But unwritten town law was very clear on the statue in the center of town: Off limits! With (maybe) penalty of death and dismemberment. Michelle had never heard of either happening but then how would you? No one ever broke the statue before now!

Michelle dashed forward and snatched up the nose. She scanned the area wildly; trees, buildings, the Canteen. Everything was closed and empty of people. Michelle spit her gum into her hand, pressed it into the back of the nose and shoved it back on the statue's stone visage.

She held it there for a few minutes then held her breath as she removed her hand. The nose stayed though it did droop slightly. Michelle cursed again and scanned her surroundings. After a moment of frantic searching her eyes stopped on a shiny piece of thin metal lying in the grass.

Michelle bent down and snatched it. She worked it slowly into the nasal passage of the stone nose and into the stone head.

The god screeched! The girl was shoving a giant metal rod into his face. Like the rock she kicked that should not have been able to happen. The god howled louder as Michelle switched to hammering the rod into his statue's nasal cavity with the rock that had broken his nose.

It seemed to take forever and Michelle's arms were tired like she had been swimming through molasses. But it was done. She bent close and inspected her work. Not bad, she thought. No one would see the rod unless the were up close. Michelle considered the way the light reflected off the visible parts of the shinny metal.

As she pondered the problem she popped another stick of gum in her mouth. She chewed then smiled. Michelle took the gum out of her mouth and rolled it around in the dirt. Then she covered the metal with the dirty gum, completely hiding the metal.

Now it will just look like it needs cleaning, Michelle thought.

"Not bad for a night's work, Minty Nose," she chuckled to the statue. "My gift to you, oh great piece of outdated garbage in the middle of my town. Minty smell and a face lift, taboot."

The god seethed as he watched the hateful girl walk away into the night. The pain was gone now. He had heard the click as the rod and gum locked into his essence when the girl unknowingly declared it an offering. It was there in his nostrils now. The smell of mint and a slight trace of canine urine and metal. In his dimension he now had a metal rod, dirt and gum attached to his admittedly already less than attractive visage.

The god cursed again--then he blanched. "I have a follower!" He thought with a sinking feeling. "A foul-mouthed sub-herd human child..." The god blanched even more as the thought finally hit bottom.

"Oh no! I have a priestess!"

This was bad. This was very, very bad. The god sniffed and received an overwhelming smell of mint. He swayed slightly.

"I hate mint," he growled to no one in particular. "And I hate priestesses. Horrid little nings."

And that was when he noticed the overly nasal quality to his voice. "Nings," he said again, trying to force the "th" sound.

"Nis is terrible," he muttered then covered his mouth. The dawn was coming soon. The Wall thickening, pushing him out of the human world--except for a small thread leading back into the mind of Michelle.

"Minty nose," he heard her chuckle. He remembered who he was scheduled to meet with tonight.

"Nuck me!" He muttered.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think you really let you hair down, no pun intended for these last two. I got a strong sense of a bubbly nature in these pieces, it kind of pops in places and feels playful. This is good examination of both the god, and the odd rules he is susceptible to and Michelle. I like the random nature of this, it feels like something a kid would do and how they may try to fix it. I like the other plan and restful element of the statue I definitely felt curious and it provided just enough for mental images without reading like it takes itself too seriously. I think that it is a good example of a fun thoughtful and mystical story. I wonder, just thinking if making an offering is a way the gang may hurt the god later like Michelle did. I think you have a great voice for Michelle and I really like her inner thoughts and worries. I want to know more about this other plane and worship stones. 
Do they exist for all gods? Do they look the same? Do people know what they are? I think this is a really cool addition to the lore we are slowly constructing :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[E"Doyle!"

Someone was shaking his leg. Doyle blinked rapidly in a vain attempt to clear his eyes. He could make out the shape of a woman's silhouette in the darkness.

"There is money in the nightstand, love." Doyle started to roll over when a hand slapped his cheek hard. He bolted to a sitting position with his fists up. The silhouette crossed its arms and waited. After a moment, Doyle rubbed his jaw tentatively.

"Bess," he said. It was not a question.

"Yes." Bess lit a lamp.

"Farm girls," Doyle muttered. "None of the jokes about the farmer's daughter ever mentioned her sucker punching a half-asleep bloke in the dark."

Bess arched an eyebrow and took a step forward. "You look awake now."

Doyle chuckled and quickly raised his hands in surrender. "You carry the day, love. I apologize." Bess appeared quite slight but that and her voluminous dresses tended to hide her strength. Doyle suspected more than one Iowa farm boy in her hometown was missing teeth.

She sighed with frustration. "Why do you always make me want to fight, Doyle? You bring me war and Harry brought me peace."

"Harry nearly sawed you in half once--"

"Harry told me about your medium," she said suddenly as if she were afraid the words would hide inside if she did not get them out at that exact moment.

Doyle said nothing for a long while. They stared at each other.

"She is not my medium, Bess," he said eventually.

"You took Harry to meet her. To her seance." Bess crossed her arms. "How could you, Doyle?"

The accusation stung more than when she had slapped him.

"Yes," he said. He could see her trying to hide her knuckles as she reflexively squeezed them into fists.

Doyle gestured towards the far edge of the bed. Bess started to object then sat down primly on the edge. He leaned back and spread his hands wide.

"How could I know she was what she said she was, Bess?"

"So you believe in her?" Bess spit the words at him. "She can see the past? Speak to the...to the..."

"The dead, yes." Doyle did not pull many punches. He suspected that was why Bess was here. She processed the words then looked away.

"Have you spoken to--"

"No, not her," Doyle said. "Only someone I knew from the war. A German. We are hoping he can find Adele."

"You are hiring a dead detective? A death detective?" Bess seemed to taste the words. She almost smirked.

"Mayhap." Doyle searched his nightstand for one of his cigars. "He was a soldier, not a detective. Farmer or mechanic before the War, maybe." He found one and lit it.

"On your side?"

Doyle shook his head.

Bess stood up suddenly and walked to the window. Nearby a train was passing. She wondered where it was going. Anywhere but here and now, she thought.

"Why now?" Bess asked. She kept her back to Doyle so that he could not see the betraying tears that slipped down her cheeks.

<em>She is stronger than most of the boys we shipped into the Kaiser's meat grinder</em>, Doyle thought. <em>You can barely see her shoulder shaking.</em> An old boxing instructor had told him once that the shoulders and hips held every opponent's secrets.

He gave her time to collect herself. Eventually he said, "I do not understand the question, love."

Bess spun around, her eyes flashing with rage. "You understand exactly what I mean, Arthur Doyle!"

Doyle smoked his cigar. Then he inclined his head in a slight nod. "I think our medium did not expect she could ever actually do what she purported to her clients."

"I want to meet her," Bess said.

Doyle sat up, spluttering. "Ah...". The cigar fell from his lips and he scrambled in the sheets and his bed clothes to find it.

"Arrange it," Bess opened the bedroom door just as he found the cigar and stamped it out against the night stand.

"Fine," Doyle yelled after her. "How did you get in by the by?"

"Either one of your whores or your cleaning lady let me in,". Bess called from the other room. "She did not clarify which and I did not ask."

He heard the front door open and close. He could just make out Bess' light tread on the stairs outside his apartment.

"Damn," Doyle said. He reached over and pulled open the nightstand. "Whore," he said.

He laid back down to sleep again then reached into his pocket for his wallet. It felt lighter than he remembered. "Maid," he said in disgust. Then he smiled. "Maybe both."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mhm, Doyle is such a great character, Bess is great too but I feel like I can hear the deep gravelly voice of Doyle. I really like their relationship, it makes me think about your second ending to the story, the one where Doyle takes there place and uh may or may not be there father of Harry's baby (one for the literary scholars ;) . I like that Doyle has to rationalize Vesla's visions, it is both unique and fitting. I don't think he would being ok with caller her a medium or magic or what have you. Also your eighteenth century lingo is scary good, I feel like I learn a new word or phrase every time I read. I think with every new story we get a bit more volume to the characters and world they live in. I am thinking how best to catagorize this story in my head, mystery, yes, comedy, yes, sci fi, yes. I think it is fun, and unique for sure, very much a Frisco original! I wonder how this relationship with Bess get's sorted with Harry, does he find out about their time together or does he know already? Does he never know then Doyle goes to hell to save his wife and *his* child? I also want to know what is Bess's long game, in this she wanted to meet Vesla, and from what I gathered find out what Doyle and Harry have been talking with her about so that she can protect Harry. It seems like she believes Harry is wrapt in the afterlife trying ti chase their lost child. Does she believe in this? Does she want to save him with reason or maybe just get him off the subject? What does Bess want for Bess? A question I think all guy writers should think about for their female characters lest they be foils. (Lots to think about there for me too...) Does Bess want to get away? Is that why she likes the train in the distance? Does Doyle want Bess or visa versa? How did they start and stop their uh foray into copulation. I also like that Doyle's first pacifying thought is a cigar. Also Bess, who I originally imagined with all the voluptuousness of a dairy cow (Women of the 1800's don't do it for me) has got some .... appeal! Looking forward to tomorrows post!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael looked up from his canvas which was blank save a blue smudge, the start of a small ocean. Ellory was laser-focused outlining an ear from a picture of Bailey. She twinged her lip pulling up on the brush trying to make the image in her mind obey. Michael watched Ellory paint, he thought of all the time they had spent together and tried not to dwell on his silly mistakes. It is unlikely you have ever known that someone was going to die before everyone else unless you are premeditated murderer or doctor about to communicate a dire diagnosis, it is strange, to say the least.It would not be long before she falls over and leaves.

Michael wanted to say something but didn't. He wanted to ask if she thought her life was a good one, but that is a comparative determination and most people don't ask if someone has had a good life up until now because it makes them sound like premeditated murderers. Besides Michael wouldn't have a response if someone asked if he had a good life while he was focusing on getting the shade of brown just right. "Sure I guess" Michael muttered and reached to the paper plate to run his brush through a globule of blue paint. Ellory didn't lookup. Michael thought to himself while smearing small undulating waves "Does anybody realize life while they live it, I seem to be looking forward to something immensely or recollecting something and seldom do I land solidly in between. When I do land in between I can't seem to stay there long, I desperately want to be here but thinking what I am going to say is keeping me from saying anything. What I should do is knocking what I am doing. The only beings I think that actually live in the moment are dogs. I miss Baily. I could go see her, wet dog kisses in the surf is a strong sensory anchor."

Ellory looked up from her canvas, "Whatya thinkin bout?" She asked. "Baily, I was thinking about the time we all went to the beach together," Michael responded a bit melancholy. "We should go again, whatya think Baily?" As Ellory spoke an audible thud could be heard. Baily the living dog had bumped into the wall walking towards the sound of her name being called. "I didn't know she was still al - " Michael's mind breaks engaged wait, no, stop he sputtered a bit " all in this room. " Michael said. "Yeah, she may not know it but she is all up in this room. And I am all in this painting. Boom! "Ellory spun the canvas towards Micahel revealing a smiling portrait of a dog that somewhat resembled Baily. Michael looked at the painting and then down sitting beside Ellory was Baily who panted and looked up towards her mother waiting to be pet. Michael smiled and got down to pet Baily. "Whatya think girl? Is your mom a great painter or what!?" Ellory blushed and reached down to pet Baily too, as she leaned she wobbled and tumbled forward. Michael reached out to grab her but couldn't keep his balance. Ellory fell on top of Michael. "Woah that was weird." She said. The two were inches apart. Michael felt her weight on top of him and studied her eyes, he was awash with the feeling of missing her. He reached his arms around her waist, she paused then reached around him and squeezed, they hugged for a long time on the floor. Baily licked their faces and they both smiled and winced at the barrage of warm dog kisses from a very alive dog.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ah ze romance!  I knew it had to be in there somewhere waiting to get out ð. Seriously though I like how Michel is so cerebral at times then something physical happens that pushes him out of his head and into the world around him.  There is a dialogue running in his head constantly (for obvious reasons).  He seems to be like an actor caught in a play where he just almost remembers the lines and blocking.  Then something unexpected or forgotten happens and catches him off guard (because memories are usually about single important moments are rarely include the mundane interconnecting ones between them).

I wonder if the picture is a good place to see how Michael is impacting the past. In the present has he seen that exact painting?  Is it different somehow now?  Also I thought it would be cool if she had two paintings.  The dog one and also one of him watching her as he painted her.  Or maybe just the dog one but he realizes he is in it (accidentally?). Nothing overt but maybe he sees that she captured some of him drawing/watching her since she drew some of  his reflection in the window.  Goes back to that âactor in the playâ concept.  Was I here when that painting was made originally/the original untouched timeline?  Maybe what was a blur the first time he saw it now he realizes is something actually in the reflection (I.e., his arm).  But I know I was  in Austin visiting my aunt on this date.  I got sick blah blah.  Then he has to consider and investigate what impact he is having on his own timeline.  

Again the actor reference.  Is he changing the play or just following the script even further? He is not moving linear in HER time but he is moving linear still in HIS timeline.  He knows he saw that arm in the past when he saw the painting and idly wondered what it was but now he knows itâs a âwhoâ.

â- 
The hug was a nice touch.  Kiss I expected so a hug was a good choice.  It puts the reader into to questions.  Are they going to kiss? (On the way in) then oh thatâs sweet they just hugged.  To thatâs a long hug and the most dangerous part of a hug can be the pulling away.  All of the extended physical contact gives a mind and a body time to think.  And there is a choice to make extracting yourself from the hug.  It was surprise on the way in, but now everyone knows where they are on the way out.  As both disengage there is a brief period where lips are close enough to touch.  A choice has to be made.  What will he do when he has had time to think?  How will he react/act then?  

Sort of the morning after situation.  Once time and sleep has worn off the alcohol how will a person react to their one night stand type of thing.

It makes me wonder about the internal dialogue of Elloryâif she is more instinctual to his cerebralness?  And also what is she thinking?  I would be curious âeven if only from a throw away exerciseâto hear what she is thinking and how she is perceiving his watchfulness.

Good work.  As always it leaves me with more questions to ponder.  ðð»]]></wp:comment_content>

If you know you will die on X date then short of getting a horrible injury that would cause you to waste those days would she  take a lot more risks and poke Death more just because she knews it is on a schedule?

Just a thought.  Michael goes through the entire story and at the end as she is dying she is like âyou were never here before.  Thank you.â]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The room was silent as the Admiral entered. He was in excellent shape, only a bit of gray shading his temples. He still looked like he could jump out of a plane into a hot LZ even though his active Special Forces days were more than two decades behind him.

He was a commanding figure, his presence like a force of nature sweeping into the room, so silence at his entrance was not uncommon. Today, though, it was for entirely different reasons.

He set a folder down at the third seat from the head of the table and sat. Calowin smiled slightly from her place at one of the side chairs along the wall. The junior officers station--where she like her fellow seat mates could be ready with a fact or figure for the senior officer or government official they supported.

That was the Admiral's way. He took a lesser position at the table to indicate free discussion was open and welcome and expected. Few quiet personalities survived his conference room for long.

"Folks," he said without preamble, "they knew we were coming. We lost a team and I want to know why."

Calowin's boss cleared his throat. "We own some of that."

That, she knew, was a little politicking. Better to be the first one out of the gate and own your piece.

The Admiral nodded for her boss to continue.

"We got duped. They knew we were listening. Obviously. But they did an end run around our best and brightest and all of our systems."

The Admiral tapped his fingers, drumming out a staccato beat.

"Sylvia?" He looked over at a matronly woman in glasses. You wouldn't know by looking at her that she wrote the book on system security--the ones secretly published for a select audience--self destruct if lost type of thing.

"We are clean, John. Triple checked. No one got in."

She was the only one who called him by his first name. Contractor, a little quirky. She once scolded the Secretary of the Navy. The Admiral collected odd types--personality was no concern as long as they were the best.

"Sir--" Calowin's boss started.

The admiral waved him to stop. An unusual gesture in this room. "No need to fall on the sword twice, Art." Calowin noted the slight tightening of her boss's shoulders. He was "Arthur".l--not "Art", not "Artie", not "A.P." (The president's nickname for him). Also part of the admiral's style: subtle disapproval.

"Sir, we did our own checks as well. Nothing from outside," Arthur continued refusing to be cowed.

"Ops?" the Admiral said looking to a giant man in a captain's uniform.

The big man chewed his lip for a moment. "Could be we missed something on the way in."

That was about as close to admitting a set back as the admiral was going to get out of him so the admiral sat back and looked around the table.

"Enough navel gazing." He stopped tapping abruptly. "We lost good people out there today. The President is not looking for heads." He did not add the implied "yet". "Ideas?"

The room was silent. They and their teams were the best of the best. If there was something that could have been done better they would have done it.

Calowin realized her foot was nervously twitching enough that her fellow wall hugger to the left was looking at her. Arthur seemed to sense her movement. He sighed.

"There is," he began slowly, "an option we have been looking at." When the admiral did not stop him, Arthur went on reluctantly.

"One of our," Calowin could almost feel Arthur smirk, "best and brightest, believes she can train a machine to recognize...ah...fake code buried in real code."

A few people shot curious glances Calowin's way, wondering if she was the "best and brightest". She blushed slightly and peered down at her notes to hide it.

The admiral was tapping again. In most people it would mean impatience but in him it was more like anticipation. "And...?"

Arthur leaned to one side so that he was no longer blocking the admiral's direct line of sight to Calowin.

"Miss Hayes, would you be so kind?"

Twenty-four pairs of eyes snapped to her face. She saw Silvia cock her head slightly. She stared at Calowin like she would at an interesting but soon to be squashed bug on her windshield. The admiral's tapping stopped.

Calowin hesitated.

"Commander, a lot of Joe's boys are not even going to get the courtesy of a body bag. If you have something that will keep that from happening again I would like to hear it," the admiral said.

"Well, sir, our initial findings indicate we can train some of our more advanced machines to recognize who wrote something and when."

"With how many words?" The admiral asked. He was no code breaker but he knew the basics.

Chairs creaked as a few people leaned in closer.

<em>Speak with authority, </em>Calowin thought. "300, sir." Then she added slightly softer. "Give or take."

More chairs squeaked, but this time as people sat back. Her fellow wall-huggers on either side edged away. Calowin knew she was blushing furiously. Fifty words was a luxury in intel gathering and code breaking, twenty was barely workable.

The admiral stared at her then at Arthur, trying to see if there was a game going on he was missing. After a moment he said, "But you are one of Artie's best and brightest so I assume there is more?"

Calowin cleared her throat. "We--well, I, actually, I believe I can get the approximate required word count down much lower."

The admiral stared into her eyes. He did not have kind eyes, but there was a hint of something in them. Amusement? That irritated Calowin. She pushed on somewhat recklessly.

"Under twenty. Maybe under ten."

Arthur visibly stiffened at that. It did not go unnoticed. This was a room of the best but also a room of sharks by nature, hunters. Blood in the water was irresistible.

The admiral waited, maybe to see if Calowin would back down. She did not.

"Twenty," the admiral said.

"Or ten," Sylvia, the head of Cyber Security offered. Sharks.

"Why is this the first time I am hearing of it?" The admiral sat back and steepled his fingers.

Arthur shifted slightly, covering Calowin. The question was for him anyways.

"There were more traditional methods available. And there has been," Arthur paused, choosing his words carefully, "resistance from some sectors that are critical to our work."

The admiral stood. "Which?"

"Tech, high level academia, one or two key individuals," Arthur said.

The admiral gathered his folder. "Sylvia and her team will liaise with the tech sector and clear the way." Sylvia sat up sharply but said nothing. Her fate had just been tied to Arthur's there was nothing for it. Maybe the admiral blamed her somehow.

"You have the full support of the White House on this." The admiral continued. "Today," he added somewhat reluctantly.

He looked at Sylvia. "Ten words."

He turned back to the room. "The rest of you start picking up the pieces while Joe and I go write some letters and make some phone calls." Everyone stood and began filing out.

Calowin, Sylvia, her junior, and Arthur were the last.

"Arthur," Sylvia said curtly. He nodded back.

After they had left Arthur turned to Calowin. "You know the house always wins right, Callie?" He left.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Woah, intense. I was just thrust into so many personalities with exactly the right intensity to feel this scene and its inhabitants. I feel like my breathing quickened as I read. 

I Like the name did you come up with Calowin? I feel like it is odd and unique but also bold and intelligent. What a great start to a story, boom commander walks in to handle a tragedy and find answers in a life or death scenario. I want more. 

I would have guessed you were in the military all of the lingo and jargon inserted into this scene as it unfolds is great. I like the fact this matronly security expert (Who is a intriguing figure I feel like I can describe entirely after a short intro)  calls him John is a great way to bring attention to the admirals stature. 

I know this was two months ago but I wanna know what inspired this? It is such an fast paced opening. I like the discussion of the code in terms of "How good can you make this." Damn it, you got to make it good or people will die. I could feel the knifes edge of ambition and huberous. Don't wan't to hold back but I also don't want to fail. 

I can feel this world has secrets and high stakes and more than one person in that room are being deceived. The sentence he did not have kind eyes but there was something in them. Amusement? It just reads so well, and keeps a rythm. It hits on the beats and echoes out to created a visual sort of experience as well. I can tell this is a thriller and I want more :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[T.J. sprinted down the hall of Wing C. He had not been here since Sarah disappeared. He slid to a stop in front of the door to the stairs leading to the boiler room.

The door was slightly ajar and T.J. peered into the crack, trying to see what might lay behind it. He could see light flickering but that was all.

Carefully, he edged the door open. Stairs led down to a shadowy corridor that turned right and--he knew from memory--led to the ancient boilers and a cot some student had stashed behind one of the boilers ages ago.

T.J. crept carefully down the stairs and chanced a look around the corner. The giant boilers that kept the school warm in the winter sat silent like sentries along the walls. In the center of the room, a medium-sized fire burned in a makeshift fire can and six cloaked and hooded figures walked slowly around it, chanting softly.

TJ edged carefully along the wall and tried not to let his movements draw the chanting figures' attention. He made it to the first boiler and slipped behind it. He saw Michelle and the other two crouching behind the third boiler. They waved him forward silently.

When he had crawled close enough, Michelle whispered to him. "You stopped to change clothes?"

TJ looked down at his football uniform self-consciously. "The game is tonight," he whispered, slightly defensive.

Michelle rolled her eyes.

"They have been circling for about 30 minutes now," Daniel whispered. He and Rodney were taking turns keeping an eye on the cloaked figures.

"No human sacrifices or anything?" TJ asked quietly.

Daniel shook his head. "No, we were here before them and we didn't see them bring anyone else in."

"Did you check the cot?" TJ asked trying to look through the opening between the 2nd and 3rd boilers.

"What cot?" Daniel said.

"It wasn't pulled out," Michelle whispered.

"Wait, what cot?" Daniel asked.

"The one behind the fifth boiler on the other side of the room," Rodney whispered without looking up. He had just crawled back to join the group.

"You know about the boiler boinging bed?" Daniel asked. His whispered was starting to become a little loud. Rodney nodded, his focus fixed on the chanting figures.

"Great, so we know which one of us we can offer up as a virgin sacrifice if they catch us," Michelle whispered. "Anything else, you--"

"Did you bring Sarah here?" Daniel hissed T.J. who suddenly found the back of a distant boiler really interesting.

"Yes, just once," Michelle said. "But it was a mistake. A beautiful mistake."

The three guys stared at her, their mouths agape. Daniel looked shocked, Rodney blushed and T.J. gave her an involuntary once over.

Michelle smiled wickedly. "Men are so easy. I'm joking."

The three boys laughed a little self consciously.

"Or am I?" Michelle said. This time all three blushed and looked away.

After a minute Rodney put a cautioning hand up. "Crazy cultist, remember? Mess with our hormones later."

As if on cue, a woman's voice said from the other side of the boilers: Are we ready yet or what?". The four froze.

"Yes," said a man's voice though he sounded like he would rather be shoving an ice pick through the woman's skull.

Rodney and TJ peered around one side of the boiler and Michelle and Daniel took point on the other side.

One of the hooded figures brought a book and a wicked looking knife from beneath his cloak.

"Let us begin," he said.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Fun fun fun. I was rapt, and I am pretty confident you wouldn't kill anyone but I got some mad goony vibes. Once again I think the hilite of your writing is the dialogue, it shines through the situation and really gives the depth of the characters. I personally get a better sense of everyone after reading what you write and I feel like I know them better. Also, I love the fact this in a school, it is such a classic setting for intrigue. 
Did Rodney bang someone on the cot down there? Was Daniel asking if he and Sarah hooked up down there? Not sure. 
I like that TJ went to change still thinking about games and everyday things, it grounds the gravitas. I also think it makes the whole thing more believable. I think high school kids would still try to fit in even the building was on fire, like they would be like, "Low key I wanna live but I am not going to ruin my reputation by acting uncool". I could feel the moments hang in the air when the woman spoke at the end. Then boom big spooky knife. I am finishing this comment so I can go read the next install, so great cliffhanger.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The hooded figure with the book and knife raised them both above his head and let out a long series of nonsensical syllables.

"Ardoth dres sopewere hiot," he said in a grave voice.

"Ardeth," said the woman. Even through the robe it was obvious she was short and portly. TJ's mind raced to figure out who it might be--someone in the town or a stranger he did not know.

"What?" said the man, lowering his hands slightly.

"It's 'ardeth', not 'ardoth'," the woman said." It is a hard 'e'."

The man dropped his hands to his side. "No, it is not. The book said 'ardoth'."

"I'm telling you, it's 'ardeth'," she replied. The hooded man turned to the figure on his right who shrugged.

"I thought it was 'ardoth', too. But it could be the other way." He was also male but had a soft shaky voice, like a squirrel or a mouse hiding from a cat.

"Well, which is it?" asked the hooded man with the book. "You are supposed to be the resident expert on this shit." He waved the book at the other man.

"Um, let me see the book again," the second man took a step forward.

"Stop, idiot!" The fourth figure snapped. The cloaked man reaching for the book stopped midstep, his foot in midair. "I told everyone not to cross the circle of salt after we started."

The man in midstep looked down. "Right." He carefully set his foot down outside the circle. "Are you sure we are supposed to be outside the circle? I seem to remember something about being inside the circle."

The woman sighed. " Did you even choose the right ritual?" she asked the man with the book and knife.

"Yes," the man replied scornfully. "I think I can at least manage that."

"The ritual we chose does not have 'ardoth' in it anywhere," she replied.

"Maybe we should start over," said one of the cloaked men.

The man with the book and knife practically screeched. "That was an hour of chanting and walking around this stupid salt circle. I am NOT going to do all of that again just because some stu--"

"Sugar," said the man who had tried to step over the circle.

"What?" asked the man with the book and knife.

"I couldn't find enough salt so I just took some of the sugars out of the cafeteria."

"Are you shitting me?! Sugar?" yelled the man with the book. He pointed the knife tip at the other man. "You can't just change a critical component of the spell."

"Well, you changed the word 'ardeth'," said the woman.

The hooded man pointed the knife at the woman. "So help me, I will--"

"People, please," said the fourth figure. He was rubbing his hand over his face beneath his hood. "We have a lot to do tonight and we still need to get these cloaks back to the theater costume room and get to the football game."

The man with the knife lowered it and the other two looked down at the ground. Behind the boilers Rodney stiffened. He looked over at the other kids and mouthed something.

"Something is wrong with the Power tonight," said the fourth figure. "It feels...dispersed." He sounded slightly confused. He pointed a finger at the woman when she started to speak. "No," he said. "Just no."

He took a moment to collect himself then raised his arms. "Oh great Mint-E-No-sea, hear the pleas of your humble servants who come before your in secret tonight." He signaled for the other three to begin to walking the circle again.

"We ask that you use your vast and unknowable Power to convince the foreigners not to close the factory."

"And the basketball State Championship," said one of the hooded men.

The fourth hooded man paused. "What?"

The hooded man who had spoken stopped causing the other two to crash into his back. Over the grumbling he said, "That championship means a lot to the Town. I think it's as important as a bunch of jobs."

"You mean important to your job," said the hooded woman acerbically.

"Fine," the fourth hooded man said slowly through clenched teeth. "Save the water bottling factory and the boys basketball team needs to win the State Championship this year."

"And the big game tonight," said the woman.

"TJ doesn't need some goddamn Power to win the game tonight," said the man with the knife and the book.

The woman crossed her arms.

"Okay," the fourth man said, exasperated. "Everyone silently think of one--and only one--thing they want. We will ask Mint-E-No-sea for a blanket blessing for those things."

"Broughton is a tough team," the woman said sullenly. "It isn't going to hurt TJ to have a little something extra out there."

The man with the book and knife shook his head and started walking again. "I cannot wait until that overgrown oaf graduates," he muttered.

"That boy is a nice boy," the woman said as she began walking. "His parents are real shitheads to him and he works so hard for this town."

The man with the book and knife muttered something else under his breath.

The fourth man rubbed at his temples then raised his arms to continue. "Hear our pleas!" He dropped his arms.

Behind the boilers TJ and Michelle both doubled over in pain. Daniel and Rodney exchanged worried glances. Daniel crawled over to them unsure what to do. He waved at Rodney to keep watching the hooded figures.

After minute TJ and Michelle stopped rolling on the ground and sat up.

"Are you two okay?" Daniel whispered. After moment both nodded.

"Let's get this over with," they heard one of the men say.

Rodney crawled over. "We have to go! Now!" he whispered.

"I am fine. Thanks," said Michelle. She was still clutching her chest. TJ was still on the ground, his eyes unfocused. He was clutching his legs against his chest, curled into a fetal position.

"Can he move?" Rodney asked. "If not we need to move him." He shot a nervous glance through the opening between the boilers. The hooded figures had stopped moving and chanting. The were congregating on one side of the circle now, struggling with something.

"Be careful with those," one of the hooded men, maybe the leader, said.

TJ waived a hand and nodded. He could move. Rodney pointed to a window along the wall. TJ nodded and climbed unsteadily to his feet. He limped over to the window, one hand still clutching just below his stomach. He stood on tiptoe and undid the latch. It squealed slightly and he winced. He started gesture to the others when his mouth suddenly dropped open.

The others followed his horrified gaze and turned around to see...

There was a flabby, milky-white mild aged man ass visible between the boilers.

"Just give me a minute," they heard the woman grumble and the sound of cloth rustling.

TJ lifted the window and frantically waved the others forward. They raced over and TJ practically threw Michelle up and out the window.

"What--" Daniel started to say looking back then was cut off as TJ grabbed him and tossed him through the open window. He cleared it easily and landed on the ground a few feet from it. Rodney quickly followed in the same manner then the two of them reached their hands down to pull TJ up and out.

They heard one of the men say "We need more people."

Then the four were running as fast as they could; Michelle cursing and TJ moaning as they went. When the made it to the parking lot Rodney signaled for them to hide behind some of the parked cars on the edge near one of the lot light poles.

Michelle put a hand on the pole to steady herself. TJ collapsed to his knees.

"What the hell was that?" he said, panting.

"Sex cult," Rodney said, looking back the way they came.

"Were those teachers?" Michelle asked.

"Three of them were, I think," Rodney said.

"And they were about to--What?" Michelle said, noticing the other three staring at her.

She looked down and gasped. Her breasts had grown by at least a cup size and were straining against her bra and shirt, painfully. She covered them with her hands.

"What the...? Wait!" She looked up. "We're one of you thinking about...we're one of you thinking about my tits while a bunch of knife wielding cultists were 6 feet away?" Rodney, TJ and Daniel exchanged uncomfortable glances. She looked into each of their faces, each looked away quickly, Daniel blushing.

"All" Michelle drew the word out, "of you were thinking about my tits."

"I swear it wasn't me," TJ said. "I find you repulsive."

Daniel shook his head.

"I'm an ass man," Rodney said.

"Ass hat," Daniel said smiling.

Michelle cast a glance over her shoulder back the way they had come. "Oh that is so groddy to the max!"

"Might have been the old woman," TJ said.

"Very fun--". Then she stopped and looked over at TJ closely. "Move your hand."

"Why?" TJ asked slowly pulling back his hand.

Daniel and Rodney both stared, shocked. They both quickly looked away. Michelle smirked.

"So," she snickered. "That is a 'little something extra'?"

TJ angrily covered his nether regions with his hand. Then he put a second hand over it.

"It looks like you have a thermos shoved into your pants," Michelle said.

"It's not funny!" TJ yelled. He pointed down. "How am I supposed to play with this?!"

"I'd say with three hands," Rodney snickered. That set Michelle and Daniel off and they started laughing.

"I'm glad I'm not hiking the ball for you," Daniel laughed.

Tears were streaming down his face. He, Rodney and Michelle had fallen to their knees. The boys were laughing so hard they were clutching their stomachs. Michelle was alternating between clutching her stomach because she was laughing so hard and covering her sore breasts.

"This could end my football career," TJ said.

"Or start a new one in porn," Michelle laughed. She was actually snorting in between her laughs.

"Please," TJ said, he pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes in frustration. "This whole night...just stop. I can't take any more. Please!"

"That's what she said," Michelle guffawed and the three laughed even harder.

TJ scowled. "There's nothing I can say right now that won't turn into a penis joke, is there?"

"I don't know," Rodney said. "Let's run it up the flagpole and see."

Daniel was rolling on the ground now, gasping. He was trying to talk but couldn't stop laughing.

"At least part of you will always be on time to class now," Michelle said. "Besides if anyone should be upset it's me. You three turned me into Christy Canyon."

Rodney and Daniel abruptly stopped laughing. All three boys looked at her. "How do you know who that is?" Rodney said.

"You think boys' dads are the only ones with a VCR in this town?" Michelle said, smirking at their sudden discomfort.

"Duck!" Daniel said suddenly.

"Why?" Michelle laughed. "Because 'Tripod' here is going to--"

Daniel dove, grabbed her and pulled her and TJ down to the ground beside him. Rodney dove down beside them. A moment later they heard frantic footsteps run past.

"...window was open so we need to check..." a male voice said as the footsteps passed. Daniel could make out a pair of penny loafers as the two sets of feet ran by.

For a few minutes the four were silent, barely breathing. They clutched at each other unconsciously, scared to move. The laughter was gone, replaced with something more akin to terror. Ten minutes passed, then fifteen. Nothing.

"I don't think they are coming back," Daniel said.

"We should still go," Rodney said.

"Thank you for saving us back there, TJ," Michelle said. Everyone was silent for second, waiting.

"Uh, sure," TJ said slowly. "It was, you know, I mean, no problem."

"And TJ?" Michelle said. "You're not a dick. Not completely anyway."

TJ groaned and shoved Michelle and the other two off of him. They all sat up.

"A bunch of real comedians," he said but there was none of his usual surliness in the words. He was also smiling. The others noticed both but did not comment.

"I need to get to the locker room and get ready for the game," he said getting to his feet. He looked down. "And whatever with this."

"We'll be in the stands," Rodney said, standing. He extended a hand to Michelle to help her up. Daniel gave Rodney a questioning look--football games were not their thing--no sport was.

"Wait!" Daniel said. He pointed at TJ's crotch. "We can use that!" The other three looked at him, waiting for the joke. "No I mean if Michelle didn't wish for it then whoever did will be watching to see if it worked. Rodney and I hate football anyways so we can keep an eye on the stands." TJ shot them an annoyed look.

"You could see that thing from space," Michelle said and TJ unconsciously dropped a hand to try to cover his groin. "No one's going to have a hard time spotting it."

"This is so not cool," TJ muttered.

"You'll be on the sidelines reporting, Michelle," Rodney said. "You watch our side of the stands and Dan and I will watch the Broughton side."

"I'm not turning my back on that thing," Michelle said, a gleam of humor in her eyes. Then she became serious. "We need to be careful. Something odd is happening in this town and now we know about it. People who do bad things in private like to keep it that way."

"You probably shouldn't talk to Daniel or Rodney or me," TJ said. "People will wonder why...". He trailed off. Sometimes the gulfs between two people in different social circles in high school were wider than two people standing on opposite sides of an ocean.

"No," Michelle said immediately. "Screw them. Screw everyone. I talk with who I want."

"Technically, no one wants to talk to you, Second Place," TJ said, but he was smiling.

"Pipe it, Pipe," she shot back, also smiling.

"Not if we have another 'TJ twister pile'," Daniel said, half under his breath.

They all looked at Rodney, expectantly. He looked at each one in turn, deadly serious.

"After School Murder Club," he said simply. "That's what we should call the new club."

"Illegitimi non carborundum," TJ said and put a hand out, palm down.<em> I actually have friends</em>, he thought.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Michelle said. <em>I barely find these guys repulsive,</em> she thought and covered TJ's hand with hers.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Daniel said and added his hand. <em>I'm touching a girl</em>, he thought.

"Illegitimi non carborundum," Rodney said, putting his hand on top of the pile. <em>x3 + y3 + z3 = 42. Cool!</em>, he thought.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Gotta love a story that ends with a group of teens putting their hands in a pile. Great imagery, that was a lot of fun from the start with the bumbling cultist to the dick jokes, I think the kind of surreal mixed with humor is a great niche. Also I know I always compliment the dialogue but this is such great team building and teen bonding. So question, the ceremony was tuned by thoughts or wishes, who wished for TJ to have a big dick? I can assume Dan wished for Michelle to have big boobs, haha. Also I like the fact Sarah thows our the vhs thing, I think she is kinda kinky like that. Ok, so TJ literally thows then out the window? Is he strong or is it Dan or both? 

Got to love sexual teenage tension, I think itâs relatable and exciting (maybe a creepy way to describe it) 

So the ceremony , I think my favorite part was the back and forth between the cultist was great. I really love the pronunciation bit and the one cult person cutting her off pre emptively to stop her from correcting him. Also the fact they got sugar is great. Maybe one could say, thatâs the reason for all these effin ants. 

So the cult, what do they know about the real gods? Anything? Are they just fumbling through? And at the end of all this, did they kill Sarah? Or accidentally kill her?

Just realized today we have been writing for almost a year! Crazy right ? 

I think this story is so much fun and once we nail out narrative it is gonna flow great because we have such great dialogue and jokes thanks to you. I read the whole thing aloud to Logan and she literally laughed out loud, so we are doing good]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Logan Stamp of LoL!!!  .  You know weâre going to have to work in a few Easter eggs to see if she catches them, right?  ð

Yeah 1 year is crazy!  Have you talked to Logan yet about her getting a second job so that you can take time off to write your acceptance speeches?  You may want to ask her to get 3 jobs so that you donât feel pressured to finish quickly and do a half ass job of it.  Last thing she wants is you to give a crappy speech accepting a major literary prize. 

I love the ant thing for the ceremony/sugar bit.  I also like the guy only using the word âeff-ingâ. Like he literally uses that instead of the F-Bomb.  Outside of the cult he is the most foul mouthed person in the entire town but once he dons his robes (stolen from the theatre club) he canât curse.

I was also thinking all the cultists get a tattoo but the first guy that does it has such a low pain threshold that he only gets a small misshapen inky dot. all the cultist just get a dot itâs so small that when they put their arms out to verify they are in the cult it is hard to tell and they spend a lot of time at meetings arguing about who is actually in the cult.

Speaking of the cult I think they are totally bumbling.  The demigod Minty Nose sort of chose one of them and then slowly recruited the rest.  (Note I think the god tries to have his followers pronounce it differently to change the narrative so to speak and undo Michelleâs name she gave him). A couple of them are there because itâs a sex cult.  They could care less about the magic.  I think the leader sort of has a clue but not much.  I think he stumbled across the book in the attic of the old man who lives forever.  I think Minty Nose assembled them to try to get his petition for more territory more weight.  Also thinking about the freeway thing you added.  I think minty got tricked by the other god.  The freeway is coming through but there wonât be any exits into Mintyâs town.  It will literally just run right through the center of town on its way to the stops / exits of the other demigodâs town.


I was thinking the woman in the cult wished for TJs large endowment but now I think the woman wished for Michelleâs breasts to grow.  That lets us use the penny loafers later as a lesbian thing.  Rodney can chastise himself for missing the connection.  âPenny loafers!  Everyone knows lesbians wear penny loafers!  How could I miss that!?!â  Or maybe take it the other direction.  Dan wished for the boobs and the woman wished for TJs...extension.  But in a rush she grabbed one of the other cultistâs shoes as they were racing to find whoever opened the window.  Rodney is unconsciously a genius data cruncher but he is still at the mercy of what data he has been getting.  He believes lesbians wear penny loafers exclusively and it makes him miss an easy / obvious connection or clue.

I need to rewrite the window thing.  Dan is the secretly strong one so I need to have TJ try to lift people out and Dan to be the one pulling people up or jumping up.  In rewrites Iâll pull in TJs clumsiness and Danâs super strength

I still have no clue who killed Sarah.  I think we said the cultists but if they did it it had to be an accident.  

But agreed on the narrative and plotting!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Micheal leaned to one side to peer past the long line that had formed at the cafeteria. A high school marching band was jamming up the que at the cafeteria. Michael looked down at his small wads of tin foil wrapped food and debated if it was worth the wait. Too late, too much invested, he would just stand and look around. We wanted to get back to Ellory they had just gone to the beach and he was trying to decide rather to go forward to a time he had charted and named the âfalloutâ which was righ after Elloryâs parents split. He had searched for attractions and planned a scavenger hunt to help distract. But Michael had also though about going to a time when they were younger and played at Ellorys House, he had strong memoryâs of riding a red wagon around and taking turns making up spy stories.

A tuba player bumped Michaels back with his tray, Michael turned to see a squinty eyed pimply faced portly teenager nudging him forward. Michael nodded to the teenager who stared straigh forward scowling. Well we are all hungry Michael thought. A small shuffle forward. On top of a high school band the school was also playing host to a gaggle bright faced summer camp counselors wearing graphic t shirts. Michael looked intently at the eblem at one of the shirts, it was a weird type of familiar. Michael had for some time felt oddly about things he saw unable to match them solidly to where they came from. Michael leaned deeply into the thought and tried to place its familiarity. It was likely in one of the memories that washed in between trips to the past. The boy with the Tuba prodded Michael again. Michael turned sharply, the portly teens kept his gaze fixed. Ah! A letter, no a postcard with Â a letter, itâs from Ellory, itâs new. Well new to me Michael thought. He turned to the tube player and turned his tray on top of his, I have got to read it, I canât rememeber what it says. Michael sifted past the crowd and trounced towards the doors. He ran towards his dorm. The letter was in a drawer underneath several pictures Michael re remembered.

Dear Mike,

I have had a most excellent summer so far and I canât beleive all that I am learning while here. I know you you are probably having a great time too and I am glad you asked to write back and forth. The mosquitoes her are re dic u lous. They are huge and all over the place. I am swatting them now as I write. Ha! So the other day we had a late night campfire and I stayed up looking at fireworks across the lake. I got a great view by walking up the slide, which had the water turned off, of course. Haha. I thought of you, it is like those times that you say things, well get sappy and tell me itâs inportant then say something super sincere. I know that I sometimes make fun of you for spontaneously becoming hyper serious with a thousand yard gaze, but I want to say thank you. Because I was thinking about something you said a few years ago, âdonât let the day go by without being mindful about where you are. It is amazing, you are amazing and you should feel the amazing.â Â I thought about that. I have thought about that and I feel like I am really soaking up the whole experience. I put my hand on a warm rail and just felt it, it was nice. Anyway, I am glad you are serious some times, I think it is nice to genuinely enjoy things. I think you do. You are a great friend and I am so glad you are my friend. Anyway time to bunk up! Got a big day tomorrow, new campers. Write me back what is something you have experienced recently. So glad you convinced me to be a counselor!

&nbsp;

Oh I forgot I told her that she would like being a camp counselor, two and a half years ago. Hmm, ok, I know where my next trip will be, got a sales pitch to make. Maybe I will add bug spray to a suggested packing list.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the reverse perspective aspect as we see Michael through Elloryâs eyes.  I was wondering if you could add the letter to the standing in line part. Like he has it and is reading it rather than having to go back and get it from the room.  That way he is even more awkwardâstanding in line, trying to remember to shuffle forward, reading the letter, getting lost in a thought, annoying the tuba player, bumping into someone in front of him etc.
It gives you room to play with a lot of different pieces(?).  For example you can take the letter in bite-sized parts or paragraphs.  Michael reads the opening passage, ponders something, gets prodded in the back by a tuba, apologizes, shuffles forward trying to hold his tray and read, etc.  It would be a bit of a balancing act (pun both intended and not intended) for all three of the Triangle: the character, the writer, and the reader.  A way to subconsciously reinforce the underlying emotions of the character in the mind of the reader.
Maybe use italics to designate what is Elloryâs letter etc.
For the letter I would Elloryâs mini-sketching and scribbles on it.  She strikes me as someone who would decorate as she wrote: chain of daisies down one side of the page, stick girl running from a giant mosquito, stuff like that.  Artists tend to think visually and that comes out in their thinking and communicating processes.  Sometimes itâs mind gum or mental candy.  They are âchewing âwhile they think about the next part or sentence they want to write in a letter or like I said with the mosquitoâa picture that encapsulates their experience and reinforces it (not sure if that makes sense).  To a visual artist saying there are big mosquitoes is good but saying/writing it and then drawing something light and funny and maybe slightly exaggerated to underscore a point.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rodney looked over at Dan pointing his eyes towards the front of the classroom. Dan was starring at the back of Michelle's head almost drooling. Dan wasn't the only one starring at Michelle, she had attracted a lot more attention since her cup size double. Dan was leaning forward to see her outline when a balled-up piece of paper struck him in the temple.

"Hey jackass" Rodney whisper yelled a few rows over.

"What" Dan said suddenly no longer at a fantasy sleepover with too few beds and too many wine coolers. Rodney looked towards Dan then up to the front of the classroom then back to Dan then back. "What?" Dan said.

"Look at Ms. Joans" He exhaled through his teeth. Dan squinted and looked at Ms. Joans who was erasing an algebra problem with a pudgy fist.

"I will help you later Rodney" Dan said petulantly, he couldn't believe he was called away from imaginary Michelle inviting Dan to share a slim bed, the smell of wine-cooler and perfume, oohhh she was so cold and so r-

&nbsp;

"No, not the problem, look at Ms. Joans" Rodney said his eyes bulging above his gritted teeth. Ms. Joans was so forgettable a person that Dan realized he didn't really know what she looked like, sure he had been in her class for two years but she was so plain she was practically invisible. Dan studied the portly stout woman wearing a jean dress with cross-sections of little quilted squares. Her dress hung down straight on either side making her look like a five-foot rectangle with a frizzy and ruddy-faced afixed to one end.

She squawked " Alright, now we went over this last week, but I think I will go over it again because the quiz grades were ... disappointing." She looked over at Rodney who was still looking to Dan for some reaction.

"Mr. Wrathbine, let's pay attention this time." Rodney looked up to her then back at Dan with an excited expression. Dan stared back blankly. He then looked at Michelle and pointed at Ms. Joans. Michelle shook her head and mouthed the word "what" but somehow with a tone even though it was silent. Rodney rolled his eyes.

"How about I do the equation this time?" Rodney said. Ms. Joans would have been suprised but twenty years of education had dulled her in all ways. It was the first time anyone besides Sydney Winters volunteered for a problem Ms. Joans chortled, set the chalk and shuffled over to her desk chair. Rodney walked briskly then turned towards the classroom at an angle and hurridly pointed at Ms. Joans and raised his hand pretending to be holding some object which he brought down again and again while forming some shape with his mouth that was either open-mouthed opera singing or some phallic imagery.

"Mr. Wrathbine, the problem on the board." Ms. Joans said shortly. Rodney looked to Dan and Michelle who were really bad at gestures and both nodding their heads in confusion. Rodney exhaled and turned towards the board. Ms. Joans took out a stack of graham crackers to munch on and chewed loudly while crumbs tumbled down her dress. She starred out the window not even looking at the board. Rodney turned to see her blank expression and quickly drew an arrow point to the block of a woman. Rodney wrote at one end of the arrow "cult". Dan and Michelle's eyes grew wide and they looked to each other then back to Rodney. The rest of the class looked confused except for Sydney who excitedly shot her hand in the air to tell on Rodney. Ms. Joans who had been conditioned to expect tattling when she saw the meanest looking girl with pigtails raise her hand snapped out of her munching trance. Rodney had to think fast before she saw what he had written. He quickly added a hump to the "l" on the board and sighed with relief as Ms. Joans began to squawk and pull out a referral.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well I peed myself slightly laughing  at Rodneyâs solution to cover up âcultâ.  I also like the introduction of Syndey as a character.  Youâre really good at organically pulling in things that paint the world picture (pigtails, the description of the dress etc).  I need to add both characters to the character matrix so that we can fill in their relationships to the other characters.

I canât remember if this is the first time seeing Rodneyâs last name but Wrathbine is epic!  Love the alliteration and the subtle darkness of the name.  Fits in with our story.  Like a little thread making up the wider tapestry.  Thousands and thousands of little threads and cool things woven in.


Bwahhhaahaha!!  Love the imagery on the sleep over /wine cooler! And also the ânodding in confusionâ line.  That is so true to life.  Also like Michelleâs âsilent toneâ sentence.  Excellent characterization.  Ditto Rodneyâs hand gesture.  Iâd maybe toss in something where Dan gets totally pissed because he suddenly imagines himself in the slim bed with Ms. Joans.  Totally kills his vibe and he throws up a little and barely manages to keep it in.  Maybe Rodney can pump his hips once or twice and really blow Sydneyâs mind accidentally.  It will work great when they adapt the book to a screen play.  ð.   

Also could lead to the team coming up with a code word or some hand signals to indicate who they think is a cultist.  We can get bit off of it where they miscommunicate and knock out one of the adults (maybe the assistant principal while they are in his office or an assistant coach or something).  Then one of them is like âI canât believe I did it!  I saw you signal andââ.

âI wasnât signaling!  I was scratching my nose.â

âWhat!!!?â

And so on.  Maybe the person they knock out is actually a cultist and they find out later while they are being held by the cultist.  âWill you look at that!  TJ was right about XXX.â  âYeah.  What are the odds?â

1 year.  Canât wait to see what this thing looks like in Dec 2020!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michelle opened the three musketeers bar and threw the wrapper onto a pile of other candy wrappers.Â  Study fuel she said to herself taking a large bite of chocolate and nougat. She turned the news paper, Ms. Hollingsworth was closing her canning business on main street and some history guy came to town to visit the home of Doland Duck. What the hell, get a life nerd. Michelle scowled judged the mans square face. Another page turned, this one to lost and found. Someone had lost a cat, someone else lost book and a school grounds keeper found a bike. Michelle's eyes grew wide and she circled the posting with yellow sharpie.

---

"I wanna know what you would do when she ain't pretty no more? That is all she has Dan, and well we ain't gonna be this pretty forever" Rodney gestured towards his face like Vanna White unveiling vowel.

"Listen I think she is funny and well ya know spunky, she doesn't take crap from anyone." Dan started softly and uncertain but grew bolder confident in his explanation.

"Ah, see you don't know? A part of any good relationship is what I like to call 'squish'. 'Squish' is like being spongy you can absorb blows and bounce back, ya know recover. Some people have no squish, make one wrong move and these people turn hard. They get mad, they yell, they take life so seriously and make all bad things your fault for steppin outta line." Rodney gingerly pointed his toe feigning the slightest of steps. "So you can't be perfect all the time, right?" Rodney pointed as he spoke, Dan nodded sheepishly. "And she will hound you whenever you are not here deluded version of perfect because she has no squish" Rodney thought about how he had made such a great case Matlock himself would be proud. "Dude" Dan said defiantly, "I think she makes me want to be a better person and I just wanna talk to her all day."Â  Dan said in a dreamy stuper. Rodney's exhale and argument recovery was interrupted by the shrill ring of Dan's telephone. Dan walked over to the handset picked it up and rested in on his shoulder.

Before Dan could say hello a voice on the other end began speaking hurriedly.

"Dan?" Michelle said on the other line. Dan smiled.

"Oh, hi! How you are?" Dan fumbled excitedly. Rodney rolled his eyes.

"Never mind that, I got something, a bike was found on the Nelson high campus, I called they guy and told him it was mine. I am heading over there now, you and Rodney and TJ need to meet me there like yesterday." Michelle said sharply.

"Ok, uhm I know Rodney's not busy" Dan said watching Rodney squirt cheese from a can into his mouth. " I think TJ has practice until six, may..."

"Ok, perfect I will get TJ, you get Rodney. How fast can you get there? "

"We are on our way! Be there in ten minutes. See ya ..." Dan heard the dial tone and realized Michelle hung up.

"Ok, we gotta go!" Dan said to Rodney a coy smile on his stupid face.

"Whats she wearing? " Rodney said .

"What? Why do you wanna know? I thought you said you would rather date a literal cow?" Dan said defensively as he pulled on his jacket.

"I appreciate a very certain few of her anatomical assets. I can appreciate the olives on a crap sandwich." Rodney cupped his hands and looked at Dan who was digging for a flashlight in the drawer.

"Cmon" Dan said shortly tossing him a heavy flashlight.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the developing relationship (one sided through it is) between dan and Michelle.  When she says forget all of that it seems like she is aware of his feelings (which would fit her secret power of hyper observation).  I also like the cheese can thing.  Good character bit for Rodney.i think you should capture Danâs reaction to seeing that though.  Does he start to stop him then realize he couldnât anyways?  Does he turn away in mild disgust?  Etc.  also I think it would be funny if Michelle always rejects Dan with that sentence about not having time for that.  Actually even funnier if she did that to all the guys.  At the start of every conversation.  And maybe for TJ they all have to resist (and sometimes fail) not to look down and see if his âswellingâ has gone down.  He takes to covering his privates which makes some of the more straight laced adults think he has joined a gang (though none exist in this town) and it throwing gang signs.

Also I like the bike idea.  This year we need to flesh out a plot :). But it is cool how everything is organically growing.

Donât forget to add Doland Duck to the character matrix Mx. great name and lots of comic potential there.  If he doesnât have sex cult written all over him I donât know who does.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It could be stated with a reasonable level of accuracy that most people in the town hated Michelle. Her piercing gaze seemed to capture each of their basest fears and insecurities. She could spit those back like machine gun bullets into a person's face as insults. Some people did not even know they had such deep seated issues until they wound up on the wrong side of Michelle's biting insults.

Doland was one of those people. He was something of a local celebrity and he had incorrectly assumed that status gave him immunity from the petty concerns of other town folk. As long as anyone could remember the Ducks (pronounced 'dukes') had been among the most important families in town. They were Water Walkers.

Legend and lore had it that in the early 1850's, Cohen Doland Duck (the 1st) had been coming home after a night of inebriated stargazing when he discovered a small fire hydrant in the center of town. He discovered it by falling over it and breaking his leg. His pleas for help were eventually answered a few hours later when the sun began to rise into the sky. (Cohen Duck--still pronounced 'Duke'--had taken quite a few tumbles over the years after a night of stargazing so the 5 hour delayed response time by his fellow citizens while uncomfortable was not unexpected). Much to the shock of Cohen's reluctant rescuers he had tripped on something that had never been in that spot before.

About six feet from the odd little statue in the town square a fire hydrant had mysteriously popped up. Fire hydrants we're not unheard of in the bigger cities like Philadelphia and New York but they had definitely not made it out this far west in those days. The town was mystified for months. The hydrant had no visible manufacturer or other identifying marks. Frannie Smythe, the town librarian, found a picture of a similar one in a book she borrowed from the State Library but even that one had markings.

Eventually the volunteer Fire Department got up the courage to turn it on. To everyone's surprise it worked. There was no known piping in the area around the town square yet there it was clear as day--crystal blue water streaming out when the Department turned the release bolt.

It was not until 1878 that the Ducks (still pronounced 'Dukes') came into the Hydrant legend again. Drought had come once or twice to the area and somewhere along the way one of the town's more industrious mayors had realized that they could sell the excess hydrant water to stricken towns around the state that were not weathering well. Over time this grew into a fairly large industry, the bottling of water in barrels and shipping them out. That is until the hydrant disappeared.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the pronunciation point, I think it makes the family seem believable and ridiculous. Especially the 'still pronounced dukes' excerpts. Also this is a great little piece of fantastic realism.The bit where the hydrant 'appears' and the towns people investigate but also just accept it and then capitalize on it. I think that is what would happen if a random unexplained object appeared to me. 
I also like this description of Michelle, just a snide piercing person. It fits with what we talked about in terms of her being unliked for magical reasons. Also an illusive town celebrity is a fun way to give the world some history. I think the sentence "He was something of a local celebrity and he had incorrectly assumed that status gave him immunity from the petty concerns of other town folk" is a great bit of foreshadowing. 
It could be that the ducks have some knowledge of the deity as he pops in and out of their family history. You know the sort that shows up gets hammered and only talks about themselves at someones retirement party. Haha. However this family fits in I like the role of small town celebrity. I think alot about power as it relates to context, ya know you could be the president of earth but if you are in a plane in a storm the pilots got the power. I think local celebrity is like that so long as you are in their town, sort of like the god.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Overnight the town's water export industry ground to a halt. Orders went unfilled and began piling up. Letters came from as far away as the capital with eventually even the governor demanding answers. But the town had none.

The hydrant was just gone. Irwin Bledsoe had shown up to start the day's water collection only to find an empty spot surrounded by 50 to-be-filled barrels.  No one had ever thought to post a guard on free water.

For a few weeks all seemed lost.  The town had recently invested heavily in their water export infrastructure and bills were coming due along with the need to decide on whether to start cancelling and refunding their customers.  Search parties had been sent out.  A few less trusting town folk had snuck into other towns in the county or across state lines to see if a rival had stolen it.  More than one fist fight or brawl at a Ladies Auxiliary bake sale had broken out in neighboring towns.

All looked lost when suddenly on a misty November night Cohen Duck (still 'Duke') had again fallen over the hydrant and broken his leg only this time it had appeared on the outskirts of town in a small glen.  Again Cohen suffered a night of chills and pointless yelling but when the dawn came and brought his sleepy-eyed rescuers now Cohen Doland Duck was a hero.

And so it had been ever since.  Periodically, the hydrant would disappear.  Cohen then eventually one of his sons, then grandsons would break a leg falling over the newly re-appeared hydrant and it would be back to business as usual for the town and its water export business.

No one knew why the hydrant always had water to give or why it moved from time to time.  No one knew or really cared why a Duck boy had to break a leg to get the town back on its feet.  And until that fateful day in July, no one knew that Cohen Doland Duck VI's life was going to change courtesy of Michelle.

When municipal water exports evolved into bottled water selling in the 30s, the Ducks held positions of minor power on the Board of the new Water company.  Mostly they were there so the Board and the town representatives could make sure there was always a male Duck in the pipeline and that he was named "Cohen Doland Duck" (still pronounced...).  Some few might consider it municipally-sanctioned prostitution the way girls were practically thrown at the Ducks until a male heir was proven to be on the way.  But those some few knew to keep their mouths shut and check their moral lines at the door.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doland had absolutely no desire to be at the Founders' Ball. He was a "guest of honor" according to his mother so attendance was not optional. His father had a very important job in the water factory that apparently Doland was supposed to inherit some day (so much for nepotism rules, Doland had thought when he heard that).

He pulled at his starched collar. His tie was practically strangling him and the collar was chafing his neck. He fully expected to see hives there when he took it off later tonight. He was just about to head over to the snack table for another bite of chocolate cake when he saw her.

Doland dropped his plate and fork at his feet then scrambled to pick it up before anyone noticed. He didn't need to worry though. Everyone was drawn to the angel in the room. Sarah entered a room and conversations stopped, people stared, boys hit puberty suddenly. She was just that beautiful. Doland had fantasized often about approaching her, extending his hand, and asking her to dance as he bowed deeply. Was it old fashioned? Yes, but couldn't a guy dream a little?

"What are you looking at?" Said a waspish voice. Doland looked around and saw his greatest fear. Michelle, Sarah's evil sidekick, staring right at him. It was like looking into the jaws of a shark (or at least what he assumed it would feel like--not ever having been allowed to leave the town to go somewhere like a beach).

"Me?" Doland asked, his voice breaking slightly.

He realized his mistake too late. Michelle had been looking past him but now her laser guided gaze locked onto him.

"Cohen," she said, sneering. "You graced this little shindig with your royal presence. How," Michelle paused, though Doland knew it was probably for effect. "...quaint."

"Michelle," he said carefully. Cohen Duck (still pronounced 'Duke') III had told him once that saying very little and making every statement potentially also be a question could get him through most uncomfortable situations. Especially board room meetings or speaking engagements in front of the plant workers.

Michelle waited and the two of them stared at each other. Doland was about to make an excuse to leave when the unthinkable happened.

The Duck family had few hard and fast rules but one that had been passed since 1934 was never ever lose your cool in public. It had only happened once in family history, during the 1920's. A young Cohen Doland Duck was drinking in a speakeasy with a few other clandestine patrons when his liquid courage clashed with his good sense. He picked a fight with a random stranger "over a dame". The fight had been uneventful but the family almost came to ruin. The first born Duck of every generation shared one quality: when they became angry they begin to splutter, half swallow their wordsï¿¼, generally sound like the character known the world over as...

"Donald Duck!" Michelle said. "Oh my gosh, you sound like Donald Duck when he's angry!" She looked shocked like She couldn't believe she had missed it all these years.ï¿¼

"I do not!" Doland yelled exactly in a voice like Donald Duck's angry squawk.

Around them people were starting to turn and stare. And then the worst of all things happened, the only thing that could've truly sealed Doland's fate and that of his family: the music stopped.

"You take it back right now, Michelle, you--" <em>Good God, </em>Doland thought<em>, I almost said 'you wascally wabbit'! That's not even the same cartoon show!ï¿¼</em>. Even to his own ears he sounded like a spluttering angry duck. He needed an exit fast.

Michelle was staring at him slightly in awe. "It's like this moment was written for you in time."

Doland smiled uncomfortably.

"My God, have you always done this?" Michelle went on. "No, I would've picked up on it and made your life a living hell. Donald Duck." She turned to the crowd that had begun to gather.

"Duck," she said simply. "Not Duke. He's Donald Duck."

Dolan was moving before he knew what what was happening. His hands reached for Michelle's throat.ï¿¼ Then something large slammed into him and he was crashing into the gym floor. He could hear his own squawking increasing. He looked up. That big jock, TJ, was standing over him looking as surprised and shocked as Doland felt.ï¿¼ The big boy looked down at his feet confused, as if they weren't his own. Doland saw TJ's hand coming at him and try to dodge to the side at the last minuteï¿¼ï¿¼. Instead almost comically he's managed to fall into TJ's outstretched handï¿¼. Doland saw stars for a few seconds then he jumped to his feet, squawked something even he couldn't understand, and dashed for the door.

"TJ punched Donald Duck," someone said as he passed through the crowd. They didn't pronounce it 'Dukeï¿¼' either. Doland wondered if the night could get any worseï¿¼.

Michelle turned to the large middle school boy. He was a giant even among high school boys and standing so close to him she expected to feel intimidated. Instead she feltâ¦strangely calm.ï¿¼ Until she saw him lick the blood off of his fingers. She wasn't the only one.

"He drank blood!!" Someone yelled.

TJ looked at the hand that was still resting partway into his mouth. "No, it's--"

The rest was lost as middle school kids ran screaming in all directions. Plastic cups of red punch and plates of cake went flying. Coach Neumann, who had been in the process of flirting with the new biology teacher, managed to look upï¿¼ï¿¼ right as 10 kids trampled him in a rush to find an exit.ï¿¼

"Wait, I--" TJ started, then stumbling back to dodge a stream of racing science geeks, accidentally smashed into the ice sculpture in the punch bowl that had been carved by someone to look like the statue from the center of town.ï¿¼ The statue shattered and people screamed.

"TJ bit me!" someone yelled.

"Run!"

"He's going crazy again!"

TJ upended a table trying to get up but slipping on spilled punch. The new biology teacher screamed in terror and loved the first thing to hand at himï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼. Cake plastered across TJ's face and he clawed it awayï¿¼.

"He's possessed!" someone said. ï¿¼

TJ half saw, half felt another plateï¿¼ of cake flying at his head from the direction of the new biology teacher. He ducked instinctively. That was unfortunate because Mr. Sanderson, the head of the math departmentï¿¼, ended up with a face full of vanilla cake. Coach Newman meanwhile grabbed a new plate of cake out of the biology teacher's hand before she lobbed it one at his star playerï¿¼ too. Unfortunately, ï¿¼Mr. Sanderson managed to clear his eyes just in time to see Coach Newman holding the plate of cake. Sanderson never cared much for theï¿¼ stuck up athletic director. He was always late to department head meetingsï¿¼ and in spite of his Neanderthal looks was just as good as Sanderson in debating minor points of orderï¿¼ and clauses in policy documents. The heads committee hadn't made a decision on anything in four years because they were still debating the wording of the 5th paragraph in the second subsection of a policy document designed to determine how the committee would discuss policy documents.ï¿¼ï¿¼. The argument has gone on so long but no one really even sure what's the debate was about and frequently and seemed both men ended up arguing the other ones point for them.ï¿¼

The cowardly cake attack only solidified the math department head's pent up ire.

"Suck it, Newman," he screamed and tossed the fragments of the cake back at his assumed attacker.

The coach having the lighting reflexesï¿¼ of a man who had not seen his toes in 15 years did manage to turn away and dodge the onrushing cake. He failed to account for and had actually forgotten about the cup of punch still in his handï¿¼. Or at least he had until he watched as the liquid from it splashed into the face of the new biology teacher.

For a moment it looked as if the biology teacher was going the swing on him then she too was hit by flying cake from the hard sciences side of the room. A side that she had originally tried to sit down on but that had scorned her since in their opinion was that biology was more of a "squishy" science like astrology oï¿¼r anthropology or any of the other -polys. ï¿¼She had been relegated to the soft scienceï¿¼ side with its troglodytes, pond scum, English teachers and non-Spanish speaking Spanish teacher, Mr. Juarez.

But an oppressed people will only take so much. Everyone in the soft side stood as a unit and follow the lead of their de facto new leader, a biology teacher, as she dove over the table and charged the evil hard science cartel.

TJ meanwhile had crawled to an open door that led to the outside. As he left on all fours he heard angry squawkingï¿¼ï¿¼ off in the distance. He knew he just made another mortal enemy somehow.ï¿¼. Tears began to well up in his eyes. He wiped them angrily. He has actually been trying to help the Duke boy up. How did things gone so wrongâ¦Again!ï¿¼?!!?

The thought came to him unbidden: Michelle.ï¿¼. Michelle was responsible for everything tonight. He would get blamed for starting all the fights. He would get blamed for scaring people.He would get blamed and spend yet more time in in school suspension which was really just additional practice time for the football team.ï¿¼

<em>Michelle</em> he thought<em>. It was Michelle. It was always Michelle</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael's dad had a habit of cycling through a set of stories from a finite repretoire. One of the regular stories whenever camping or taking vacation is mentioned was about a cold camping trip. It went like this Michael's dad and his two brothers decided to go camping on mount morrow and a storm blew in dumping snow all on the mountain side. It got so cold the brothers had to get into one sleeping bag for warmth. The telling of this story is accompanied by a generational pride and bluster and a heap of reminiscence.

Here's what confused Michael, why did his dad remember so fondly something that seemed unpleasant and forgettable. Why did that stick.

"It's for selfish reasons I assure you." Michael Said to Jay. "I want to know why I think about a trip home from piano lessons when I was twelve?" Jay put his thumb and forefinger underneath his chin in a sort of forced concentration pose. "Well I think it's kind of like Hamlet, when Hamlet puts on a play for his uncle to make him feel guilty. He saw something that was a big deal to him in the play." Jay said gesturing with his hands all the while oozing a sticky awkwardness of a theater kid always somewhat acting. "Jay, you say some insightful things. You wanna know a memory that plays in my head again and again? Something that keeps me up on nights like this?" Michael said looking up at the stars.

Jay sat up and said "Twad be an honor."

Ellory walked in the cafeteria she was wearing brown pants and a purple blouse with a brown blazer. Her tray plopped down.

"Potatoes, this meal is all potatoes. There are fries mashed potatoes and looks here a tiny piece of chicken." Ellory gestured with her fork. " I know it's not a Michelin star restaurant but c'mon we can at least get three ingredients in our meals. "

"You don't want your fries?" Michael said reaching for a crispy fry.

"Ahhh- No of course I want them! They are the only good thing in this meal." She snatched the fry and licked it.

"What makes you think that will keep your fries safe?" Michael said peering down at the crispy brown morsels.

Ellory doubled down on her strategy licking all her fries one at a time.

Michael quickly grabbed a long crispy fry and Ellory looked on her chin resting on her fist. Michael moved the fry towards his mouth. Ellory lifted and eyebrow. Michael opened his mouth to take a bite, Ellory's eyes grew wide. He crunched down and starred across the table making a show out of savoring the fry.

"Whatya think about that?" Michael said swallowing.

"Your crazy." Ellory said. " I thought they were safe, guess I will have to come up with a new strategy for keeping my food safe around you." Ellory said crossing her leg underneath the table grazing Michael's knee.

&nbsp;

"Well it is not nothing, I think that is a very nice thing to remember." Jay said.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good lord man!  What keeps Michael up at nights?!?!  I like the scene but now Iâm wondering if M completely changed the flow of the conversation because Ellory walked up and she is the thing that keeps him up at night. I like how Jayâs character is defined in just a small gestures and comments about his manner. The theater actor who never stops acting. I think it says a lot when
I can tell who he is and what his story is even if I donât remember him specifically since itâs been a while since he came up In the stories.

I like the way you talk about Michaelâs father in the stories that he tells. It is true that we always remember the bad terms or the tryin times and we tend to remember them with humor.  Not that this is relevant here and I was thinking the other day how struggle is Intrachol to humans. The desire always seems to be to find an easier path an easy life. Like retiring at 25 so that I can â Do what I want to do. âBut in reality the things we want to do or what we do in our few precious moments of spare time. Those are the most important things to us. If we had A ton of free time and money to do things with weâd really be filling the space of boredom. Things matter more when you have to choose one thing over another. 
When my 2.0 was young I told him to play Iny Meany mi no moe to make decisions. I said do that and if you donât like the answer you get obviously thatâs the wrong choice do it again with the remaining choices. Eventually youâll find that no matter how many times you miss it one choice is what you always want to come back to but the only way you know itâs the one you want is when you have to give it up in exchange for something else.

To take that back to Michael. He has to wonder why certain memories stayed in his fatherâs head when others did not. What was it about that memory that made him keep it in exchange for probably thousands and thousands of others. You address it because he talk about the familial pride etc. etc. 

But I like that because itâs like a double thing first you put the story out which is a funny one second you talk about how it was a miserable experience and the unsaid underlying thing is probably there was lots of fighting and arguing and bitching and moaning from everybody there, then third You talk about what it meant to his father. I suppose thatâs why am curious to see what Michaelâs been staying up late at night thinking.

Also how Ellory brushing her knee into Michaelâs leg makes me wonder if thereâs something developing there. I think for young people even if they donât end Up together thereâs always some level of sexual attraction that has to be dealt with either individually or together. Is it just a flirtation? is it an accident?  Maybe itâs all the above. Conflicting emotions and motivations and being confused by the mall is stock in trade for the teenage years. 

 Anyways Iâll be interested to see If Michael takes up the conversation with Jay while Ellory is there or wait until sheâs gone.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory strolled up the ramp between school buildings, school had let out an hour ago and she was staying behind to help Tiny Allison with Science. TA was giggling the whole time and didn't seem to be remembering anything Ellory told her. Four times she repeated "Initiation, elongation, termination." Allison would look up towards the ceiling exclaiming "I don't get it!" What's to get? Just remember those words in that order. Uhhh. Eventually the two started talking about boys.

"So, if you could 'initiate' with anyone who would it be?" Tiny Allison made a tiny thrusting motion.

"Well everyone knows Mr. A is hot so, yeah. And I used to like David but he is all cool kids and self obsessed now." What about you?

"I would give my left little toe to go out with Jay. He is the right kind of weird. And we both love theater we could open our own one day! Plus he would totally gets me drama wise, ya know we would be like so intense. I would dress him as Mr. Darcy and I could dress as the nude housekeeper" Allison licked her tiny lips. Ellory snorted with laughter.

"Gosh, leave something to the imagination my lady." Ellory bowed slightly.

Allison laughed then bit down on her tiny lip and rocked her shoulders excitedly. The two locked eyes and got quiet. "What?" Ellory said.

"I know someone who likes you? He is cute and caring and in theater! And I think you like him too." Allison looked intently at Ellory with her tiny gaze waiting for a guess.

Ellory looked down at her shoe, her big brown eyes sheepishly considering.

"Michael?" Ellory said almost inaudibly.

"Wait, you like Michael?" Allison said a tiny bit deflated.

"Uhm, I don't know, no. I was just guessing. Who then?"

"Ok, well it is a little less exciting now not going to lie, I thought you would guess, I would say yes and ya know. Any way it's Zeb." Allison said going from bubbles and giggles to answering a math question after the bell has rung.

"Oh" Ellory said.

"Oh!?" Allison repeated but tiny.

"I thought he liked Kelly, then I thought he was on the whole relationships only take away from inner chakra thing. Then he swore off high school girls because they were too immature. Then he said the best girlfriend is a digital one. Then he was in a relationship with that profile that we later worked out he made. Then he was gay for like a week. Then he ..."

"Ellory stop, yes, yikes" Allison giggled "I had forgotten about the Fillary the Finnish exchange student." Allison slapped her small(tiny) knee "But stop, yes. Zeb has had a ... complex series of relationships. Well, not relationships. He has had a complex love life. But you two are close right?"

Ellory nodded. "Yeah we are good friends."

"So? What should I tell em?" Allison waited in tiny anticipation like a small used car salesmen closing on a lemon.

Why the hell is Allison in my non existent relationship with Zeb she thought. Ellory popped over frustration, coy reluctance, and finally resignation. For the sake of protecting Zebs pride and not splitting the friend group Ellory decided she would drive the lemon. I may even get some free dinners and movies Ellory rationalized.

"Yes" Ellory said with the tone of air escaping a balloon.

Tiny Allison hopped down from her stool and ran to the door of the science room. She flung the door open and ran down the hall. Ellory packed up her stuff and walked to the hallway. She looked down at her feet. Shit, Allison didn't wanna do tutoring this was all a tiny scheme. Ellory bumped into someone in the hallway.

"Oh sorry!" Ellory said.

It was Michael.

"Hey, sorry I didn't see ya there. What are you doing her so late? " Ellory said excitedly.

Michael wobbled a bit and blinked a few times. Then he extended his hands and touched his fingers to his thumb on each hand. He then looked at his watch, "I got it" He said to himself. The looked up surprised to see Ellory standing there.

"Oh, hey Ellory, I wanted to tell you something. You got a minute?" Michael said. The two were standing in a an empty hallway.

"Uhh.. yeah." Ellory said unsure on whether to remark on his selective attention.

"Ok, so I have been thinking a lot about you and me and how this all ends up. Well I don't mean ends, but you know college and our relationship in college. And well I need your advise. Wanna walk to Sardis Park?"

Ellory would have said yes. But Allison re emerged dragging Zeb by the wrist.

"Say hello to your new boyfriend." She yelled down the hall.

"Oh you two are dating?" Michael said.

"No, well, not no, yes. We are, but..." Ellory trailed off.

"Hiya E." Zeb said pulling his wrist free of Allison and straightening his fedora.

"Hey Zeb" Ellory said smiling, eyes darting back and forth.

Zeb walked up with what looked like a big bear hug. Ellory reached out to hug Zeb, when the two got close Zeb planted a open mouth kiss on Ellory. Allison squeeled with delight. Ellory's eyelids receded into her skull. The kiss dragged on, Ellorys flat palms flailing a bit.

"Aren't they cute?" Allison said to Michael.

He tapped his forehead.

Ellory stepped back and looked Zeb then at Michael.

He was blinking and wobbling again.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Iâm  glad you gave Ellory some time.  Really great stuff in there.  Let me try to take it in sections:

1) love Michaelâs wobbly and fingertip thumb stuff.  I have been waiting for some sort of physical manifestation of his traveling and how he centers when he arrives in the past or maybe this is a sign of âtime fatigueâ?  Either way really great!  

2) Elloryâs inner dialogue about Z is excellent and the banter between E and Tiny is funny and also stands on its own well.  By that I mean if you never wrote âxxx saidâ Iâd still know who was speaking because they are both so fleshed out perfect in the dialogue.

3) Hug fake out  into open mouthed full tongue kiss.  Man that Zeb is an artist :). The fedora i laughed out loud over.  It was like yes of course Zeb wears a fedora.  Zeb reminds me of that guy who likes everyone and everything for a short time then moves on to the next thing.

4) itâs telling that Michael  is first to Eâs mind when someone says âI know someone that likes youâ.  Good job saying without saying that it has obviously run through her mind at least once or twice.  Itâs cool that Zeb can provide a foil now but for Eânot for Michael. M knows that Zeb is not in Eâs future so he can dismiss him out of hand and continue to focus on the mission.  If you know a situation is temporary you can usually ignore it.   But E may totally misread Mâs actions and think that M is jealous or stand offish or âacting weirdâ and so on.  She can read into his words.  You can play with a double set of dialogue now that the story is so well set up.  

Michael can be focusing on his mission and get so cerebral that he misses that E is scrambling to figure out what is going on with him and consequently with the two of them.  Michel can say stuff like âYeah Zeb is like two months for you at mostâ and piss E off accidentally with it.  And so on.

5) great characterization of Tiny.  A little sexual frustration, a little living through other people, a little flightiness.  But also I wonder if she has an ulterior motive.  If E is with Zeb then itâs open season on MICHAEL.  

Good work.  It looks like Ellory has been spinning around in your mind and this piece came out really well thought out and executed.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Doyle, do you ever do things just because they are the right thing to do?"

Harry stamped his feet, trying to warm up his bod.Â  He was convinced that his blood had frozen over hours ago.Â  Inside his jacket pockets, Harry's hands and fingers nervously danced moves to pick locks.

"What?" Doyle hissed.Â  Somewhere he had acquired a bowler hat and now had it pulled tightly over his ears.Â  It looked slightly silly but the two were freezing and even Doyle's eternal temper had dulled slightly.Â  Though only slightly.

"What the devil kind of question is that, Harry?"

"Is that a no?"Â  Harry mentally switched locks; now a padlock for his left, safe combination for his right.Â  Once he had practiced each of the major names locks; one in each hand.Â  Then he learned to work one in each hand at the same time.Â  A decade ago he had quit carrying most locks since he knew them better than most of their manufacturers.Â  Eventually he did not carry any but still his hands danced their complicated dance at the edge of his periphery.

Doyle grunted and peer around the corner again.

"Our Mr. Doyle here does the right thing all the time, Mr. Harry," Dobbs said.Â  He was wrapped in a thick jacket and sported a giant fur cap.Â  Harry suspected it had come from the gypsy's house, though, not during any visit he or Doyle had been at.

"Do tell, Dobbs, do tell," Harry said.Â  Doyle moved and Harry took his place at the corner peering around.

"Stop that!" Doyle barked.

"Me?" Dobbs asked. "I was--"

"No, Dobbs, I am speaking to my curious cat here," Doyle said, rubbing his hands together.Â  "It will come Harry, come away from the wind."

Harry stepped back deeper into the alley.Â  He pulled his hands out of his pockets and stretched them out.

"Why dah you do that, 'r. Harry?Â  That thing with your hands?"

Harry looked down at his hands, the fingers twitching patterns.Â  "I prefer not to die."

"He practices picking locks," Doyle said.Â  "Like that cousin of yours only Harry gets paid to break into and out of places."

Dobbs considered for a moment.Â  "Oh, 'e gets paid, too, me cousin.Â  Or did."Â  He dragged a finger across his throat.

"Dead?" Harry asked.Â  Doyle peered around the corner then motioned for them to follow him.

"Oh no, 'r. Harry.Â  Married, not dead," Dobbs let out a giant laugh at his own joke.Â  "Had ta sell his kit and get a real job."

Doyle shot Dobbs a sour look.Â  "He works that damn joke into every conversation, Harry.Â  I think he is trying to killÂ  me with stupidity."

Dobbs and Harry followed Doyle around the corner and out into the roaring wind.Â  It was bad in town, whipping around the buildings, knocking down the unwary or unsober.Â  But here on the water it was nearly impossible to stand against its frequent blasts.Â  Doyle made his way carefully down a rickety dock towards a shadow moving silently along it.

Two men jumped out of the small craft and Harry felt Dobbs' pace increase until he was immediately behind Doyle.Â  The men had carried lines with them and now were tying down the boat to the dock's cleats.

"How long are you planning on staying here?" Doyle asked one of the men as they approached.Â  The man's features were hard to make out in the gloom.

"Not long now," the man had a slight whistle when he spoke.Â  The other man finished tying out and scrambled back onto the boat.

"Stay close," Dobbs muttered to Harry.Â  He eyed the boat and the sailor in front of them warily.

"Make it quick," Doyle said.Â  "It's cold."

"Where's your lorry?" asked the sailor.

Doyle backhanded him.Â  The man's head rocked backwards.Â  Harry felt Dobbs tense beside him and put a hand to Harry's shoulder.

"Problem?" Dobbs growled to Doyle.Â  The sailor held up a hand as he rubbed his jaw with the other.

"No problems," said the sailor.Â  He looked up and up some more until he could meet Dobbs' eyes.Â  He spit something into the water.Â  "Needed it pulled anyway.Â  Rotten."

Doyle turned his back on the sailor and stepped towards the gangplank the other sailor was dropping onto the pier.Â  The sailor on the dock cleared his throat.Â  "A tooth's a tooth, Fancy, but a man's ship is his woman.Â  Even his mates have to earn their way on it."

He smiled and Harry could see the thin trickle of blood coming from his mouth and dripping down his chin.

Doyle stepped back and smiled warmly.Â  "Then let us leave it at the tooth."

After that the three stood back while the sailors unloaded the crates.Â  Six in all.Â  Once they had finished, the sailor produced a chit and a worn marking pencil.Â  He handed it to Doyle.Â  "Your mark," he said.

Doyle took the paper, scribbled something, then handed it back.Â  "Bon Voyage," Doyle said and grinned widely.

The sailor stared at him for a moment then shoved the paper in his pocket and went to work freeing the line from the cleats.Â  The three stood, waiting until the ship cast off.

"So have you?" Harry said.

After a moment of silence, Doyle looked over.Â  "Have I what?"

"Done something solely because it was the right thing to do?" Harry said.

"No," Doyle said quickly.Â  He checked his pocket watch then looked out over the water.Â  "No.Â  Sometimes I think so, but there always turns out to be a self benefiting motive hidden under the action."

Doyle put his hands against one of the crates.Â  He looked up and realized Harry and Dobbs were staring at him.Â  "Well, it is the truth."

"I see that," Harry said.Â  He stretched his hands again then placed them besides Doyle's on the box.Â  "It is more honesty than I expected."

"What?!" Doyle bellowed.Â  He shoved the box and it went flying into the frigid water beside the pier.Â  The three men stepped forward and peered over the pier watching it.

"All the way down and gone," said Dobbs.Â  Doyle grunted agreement.Â  He stepped over the another crate and put his hands on it.Â  "Can you think of one time you did something, Harry, that was not motivated by self interest?"

Doyle pointed to a nearby crate and Harry went over and put his hands on it.Â  They pushed at the same time and the two crates went toppling into the water and sank out of site, though Harry had stumbled once or twice on the slick dock as he pushed.

Doyle looked over the side and nodded.

"Deep here, isn't it?" Harry said.Â  He stamped his feet again.Â  Out here over the water it was somehow even colder than the shoreline.

To their left, Dobbs rammed a crate with his shoulder until it slid to the edge of the pier and tottered over.Â  It hit the water with a loud splash and a slight splintering of wood.

"Too close," Doyle scolded.

"Ts heavy one there, 'r Doyle," Dobbs grumbled, massaging his beefy shoulder.Â  He walked over to another crate and tested it with his hands.Â  "Dis too!"

"I am aware, Dobbs.Â  I watched them unload so I could see which was the heaviest and leave those for you and Harry." Â  Doyle tapped his finger to his nose.Â  "See?Â  Self aggrandizing motives."

Harry frowned.Â  He opened his mouth to respond.Â  Doyle waved him towards another box.Â  "Less talk, more pushing," he said.

The three men pushed at the remaining three boxes, trying to angle them so that they went off the dock towards the deeper water.

"Never once.Â  Even for me?" Harry asked as he strained.Â  Doyle was pushing with a single hand, easily sliding his box forward.

"Especially not for you," Doyle said.Â  "I am not sure why you keep showing up at my flat every morning."

"We...go...over...to...his...house," Dobbs grunted through gritted teeth.Â  He pushed and shoved his box with his shoulder.

"True," Harry said, also straining.Â  Doyle's box went over the edge first.Â  He looked between the struggling Harry and Dobbs then stepped back and sat on one of the cleats.Â  He pulled out a cigar and lit it while he waited.

"With haste, gentlemen," he said.Â  Harry and Dobbs continued to shove, curse and push their boxes until both had gone over the side and splashed into the water.Â  Doyle gave them both a moment to catch their breath then stood.

"Let us make haste, boys," he said, "There is a strong drink with my name on it waiting for me at the Club."

Dobbs straightened and helped Harry to his feet.

As the three men walked off the pier Harry shot a quick look back towards the water.Â  "The men Dobbs' friends are entertaining at the bar currently?"

Doyle puffed as they walked only slowly to a more leisurely place once he had made it to the safety of the alley.Â  "Dead by tomorrow, by the end of the week at the latest."

Harry turned slightly pale.Â  "Are you quite serious?"

Doyle chuckled.Â  "No," Doyle said.Â  "Most likely the men will spend a cold night in the alley waiting for a ship that has already said onto new nefarious duties.Â  Ships are lost at sea all the time.Â  They will report that back and no one will be any the wiser."

Harry was not convinced.Â  "So their boss won't kill them?Â  For losing all of that contraband cargo?"

"O' course not, 'r Harry," Dobbs laughed.Â  "It was probably women's stocking in those boxes.Â  Nothing too bad.Â  Just wantin' to skip the tug tax."

"Mine must have had stockings made out of rocks," Harry said, wincing with the memory.Â  "Big ones."

They exited the alley.Â  Dobbs headed over to the car and opened the door for Harry and Doyle.Â  Harry climbed in and Dobbs closed the door.Â  He walked around to the other side of the car.

"What da' ya t'ink was really in those there boxes, 'r Doyle," Dobbs asked quietly as he opened the door.

Doyle shrugged.Â  "Contraband.Â  Guns?Â  Who knows.Â  Something bad that will never be used now for its intended design."

Dobbs shrugged as well.Â  "Long as, 'r Harry is 'appy, I suppose."Â  He looked at Doyle.Â  "Them men are dead men though.Â  You know that."

From inside the car, Harry yelled out.Â  "What are you too talking over?Â  It is too cold for that even in here."

Doyle winked as Harry then his face dropped into a neutral expression.Â  "I know," he said as he climbed into the car's rear seats.

"Home, Dobbs," Doyle said as Dobbs climbed into the front seat, behind the steering wheel.

"Not going to the Club after all?" Harry asked.

Doyle shook his head and stared out the window at the snowy road.Â  "No.Â  I think I have had enough fun and good deeds for one night," he said quietly.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The plot thickens. I like the turn in the action and the questions concerning if they are the "right" thing to do. My first question, why does Harry want to know if Doyle has ever done a good thing for the sake of it? Second this ties into the second ending of the story well, wit Doyle doing something selfless and "right". Maybe the right thing is something he is unsure of due to his military service and his encounter with the German. 
The return of Dobbs, he is a great character. I think he really contrast with Doyle and they are kind of a duo in some ways. I like his jokes about Marriage, I wonder what Doyle and Harry's perspective is. I could imagine Doyle might say it isn't so much loyalty and respect for the institution sake but for those you share love and respect for. But who knows he may be unhappy with the whole notion of marriage. 
I like the descriptions of the cold again and again, I could feel London weather in it and it had a good scene building affect. 

Ok, confession, I am not sure why Doyle hit the guy? Also I lost track of the conversation about the tooth as well. I may be just misreading some piece of that section but who knows. 

So the ending with Doyle shielding Harry from the truth that those guys would probably be killed for losing their loot I think works very well in Harry and Doyle's relationship. Doyle didn't tell Harry about the paternity of his child. Also Doyle probably thinks of Harry as unstable and tries to protect Harry because he thinks he is prone to getting upset. I definitely see the shape of Harry as a unhinged, passionate, and focused to the point of obsession coming into view from the past few stories. 

Also why are they dumping these things? What is Doyle's ( I got the sense it was his idea) plan in trashing that stuff? Is a little less contraband enough to move Doyle to act? Great as always sir!]]></wp:comment_content>

There was a rustling in the crate a few yards down from TJ then Michelle poked her head out.Â  "Well, you certainly can't do the 'left' thing, can you Tripod?"

TJ stared, his jaw working while he considered her response.Â  After a minute he scowled.Â  "That was a joke?"

Michelle ducked back into the crate she was searching.Â  "You are brighter than you look, TJ.Â  Eventually."

TJ pried open another crate with his crowbar,Â  this one with a bit more force than necessary.Â  They searched in silence for a while then Michelle climbed out of her crate.Â  "Was that a real question, Tripod?"

TJ looked over.Â  He stared for a full minute processing.Â  Michelle had realized that while he could move like lightning physically, TJ's mental leaps took a bit more backing up to hit a full run.Â  She waited.

"You mean about doing the right thing?"Â  TJ shoved the contents of the crate back into it and wrestled the lid back into place.Â  Michelle decided against commenting on the amount of time it took him to connect the dots--man with short temper, large crowbar was a bad combination in confined spaces.Â  Instead she nodded.

"Hand me those nails," TJ said.Â  He pointed to a few that had rolled near where she was standing in his overzealous opening earlier.Â  "Yes, about doing the ri--the correct thing."

Michelle's lips quirked into a half smile.Â  "TouchÃ©."Â  She scooped the nails and tossed them over.Â  TJ caught them against his body and let them fall into his free hand.Â  Michelle reached into one of the haphazardly opened crates they were still searching and pulled out a bottle of water.Â  She sat on the ground with her back against the crate.Â  They were in the warehouse of the local water botting company.Â  Crates, presumably full of bottled water, were lined up in neat rows by the hundreds.

Michelle looked at the bottle's label.Â  It showed a picture of the town square.Â  She recognized old Minty Nose's statue and smiled.Â  The label was computer drawn, lots of little dots, but she felt like she could almost see the tiny break in the statue's nose that her gum was still apparently holding in place years later.

"No," she said simply.Â  "I don't ever do the right thing so the question is irrelevant.Â  My turn."Â  She took a deep breath.Â  "Did you kill Sarah, TJ?"

TJ stared at her but not with the look he usually got that indicated he was doing Herculean mental calculations.Â  He looked...guilty.

"No,"

"But..." Michelle prompted.

"But I wanted her to die," TJ said.Â  "She was doing it with a teacher."Â  TJ swung the crowbar like a baseball batter taking a practice swing.Â  "Did you know that?"

Michelle shrugged.Â  "Sarah never said as much, but I, I had my suspicions.Â  She seemed so happy all of a sudden."

TJ stared at her and there was the slightest tinge of menace in his gaze.Â  She held up her free hand, palm out in surrender.Â  "Let me finish, Tripod."Â  For some reason hearing her insult him calmed him slightly.Â  He lowered the crowbar but did not put it down.

"She," Michelle took a swallow of water, "was really concerned with 'adult' stuff.Â  Ever since we were kids--like little kids--she wanted to grow up, have a husband, and a dog."

"A dog?" TJ walked over to another crate.Â  "She never mentioned dogs to me once."

"Maybe it was a baby, who cares.Â  You get my point?" TJ nodded.

Michelle grabbed a water and tossed it to TJ.Â  He caught itÂ  in the hand holding the nails.Â  Why are the lights on anyways, she thought.Â  The company always kept the fluorescents on in the warehouse.Â  Supposedly it was to stop theft because you could see inside and spot thieves.Â  There were no windows, though, which limited the company's plan somewhat.Â  Also who bothered stealing water?Â  But the more Michelle dug into and saw--really saw--the town she lived in the more oddities she found.Â  The kind everyone knows about but never thinks to put all together to see the pattern.

TJ was still waiting for her answer so she dismissed the lights from her mind and continued.Â  "Around middle school, when we found out about sex Sarah got really depressed."

"You learned about sex in middle school?" TJ asked, astonished.

"No, Tripod, we asked about the birds and bees in science class and someone let slip that it was a metaphor for sexual intercourse," Michelle said.

"Really?" TJ said.Â  "That's--"

Michelle rolled her eyes.Â  "No, doofus, weÂ <em>learnedÂ </em>about it in freshman year along with everyone else.Â  But we started talking about it in middle school.Â  It was like a sign of being grown up we thought."Â  She drained the last of her water bottle and tossed it back into the crate.Â  "Wait when did you learn about sex?Â  In fr--"

"Way earlier!" TJ said quickly.Â  "Like middle school.Â  No before.Â  Like elementary school.Â  Early elementary school.Â  Yeah, we all, all the guys talked about it.Â  All the time.Â  I talked about it all the time."

Michelle let him ramble until he sputtered out weakly with "so I knew about it really early..."

"Great.Â  You are a healthy American boy," she said.Â  "Back to the bedtime story you asked me for.Â  So Sarah got depressed.Â  Who wants some stupid guy to pee inside your vagina?"Â  Michelle held up a hand to forestall TJ's comment.Â  "I know, but when you're a newly minted middle schooler and an 8th grader in all her wisdom tells you something you listen."

"I never peed on Sarah," TJ said quickly.Â  "She didn't ask--do you think--"

"No," Michelle said and tried to keep hey eye roll from sending her into stroke territory.Â  <em>How has the human race survived this long with half the population complete morons,</em> she thought.Â  "No, we knew by 7th or 8th grade that urine had nothing to do with making babies.Â  So I doubt our mystery Romeo was...look, moving along, so Sarah got depressed.Â  Like curl up on the bathroom floor and listen to U2 depressed.Â  Husband was a checkbox, like baby, dog, etc."

TJ walked over and sat next to her, leaning against the box.Â  He reached over his head and grabbed two more water bottles.Â  He offer one to Michelle.

"She never connected kids and husband to 'guy?" TJ asked, but it was not really a question.Â  "So why date me?Â  Or any of us.Â  There were like 3 guys before me."

"Eight, actually," Michelle said.Â  TJ gave her a sidelong glance.Â  "But most of those just peed in her," Michelle said and then counted in her head.

"You're joking around," TJ said.Â  <em>Fifteen seconds</em>, Michelle thought.Â <em> Our little knuckle dragger is getting faster.</em>

"Two before you.Â  Doland Duck and Jimmy Garrano," Michelle said.Â  "The third was Reggie--"

"Big Reggie or Little Reggie?" TJ said.

"Little," Michelle said.Â  "I think," she added after a moment.Â  "No, Big.Â  They did closet time once for about 30 seconds."

"That's right, 'The Biter'," TJ chuckled.

Michelle finished her water and stood up.Â  She chucked it into the open crate.Â  "Hey, don't laugh.Â  We hear all kinds of stupid stuff in middle school.Â  Sarah really thought 'light nibbles on the neck' was a thing.Â  Be glad you were past the learning years."

TJ got up and stretched his back.Â  "Reggie looked like a vampire almost got him."Â  His smile faded.Â  "So I was a boy and she wanted a man?Â  That type of thing?"

Michelle pointed to a sealed crate and nodded.Â  "Something like that."

TJ placed the edge of the crowbar against the lip of the new crate's lid.Â  "Thanks for being honest with me, Second Place."Â  There was no bite in TJ;s nickname for her when he said it this time.Â  "You're not so bad sometimes."

TJ looked down at the crate and then the crowbar.Â  He pulled it out and peered at the tip.

"What?" Michelle asked.Â  She had started to move towards another opened crate but paused.

"Did you hear that popping sound?" TJ asked.Â  Michelle looked around, listening intently.Â  The giant warehouse was lit up but silent.Â  She shook her head.Â  Had someone gotten in through the single door in the far wall without them hearing it.Â  She looked and saw that the bar they put to lock the doors from the inside was still there.

"Maybe someone was inside before we got here?Â  In one of the crates?Â  Or creeping around?" she edged down and picked up the second crowbar TJ had brought with him.

TJ put the tip of his own crowbar back into the lip of the crate's lid.Â  "No way.Â  We would have heard them by now.Â  It's been hours."

"Okay," Michelle said.Â  She did not sound convinced.

TJ chuckled.Â  "Creep."Â  Michelle raised an eyebrow.Â  "Sarah, always saying that, remember.Â  This guy was a creep, that guy a creep.Â  Like she was upset about the whole world being in love with her.Â  Like who could help it?Â  I mean look at her she was perfect.Â  But it pissed her off all the same."Â  TJ worked while he talked, grunting and looking for the most ideal leverage.Â  Michelle continued to scan the other cartons and the rest of the warehouse.

"Creep.Â  That was her favorite word some days," TJ went on.Â  "And you know--here stand back, this one was tougher than the rest--you know sometimes she could be a real royal class bitch."Â  TJ looked up. "Weird, that popping sound again.Â  Maybe it's my shoulder since I'm the only one working here.Â  Did I tell you my dad wants to get me sports injury insurance?Â  What is that even--hey, you okay, Second?"

Michelle stopped her scanning.Â  "Sorry, TJ.Â  Spidey-senses and all that.Â  Come on let's finish this.Â  Finish opening that crate.Â  That will take us down to 1 million left to search for something we have no clue what we are looking for."

TJ pushed and the crate lid started to come, but then there was a large cracking sound and it split in half.Â  The non-nailed piece clattered as it hit the floor.Â  TJ cursed he reached down to grab the broken piece when he heard Michelle's sharp intake of breath.Â  He stood up, broken wood forgotten.Â  Michelle was staring into the crate with her jaw open.

TJ was silent for a moment.Â  "Looks like we need to open 1 million more crates tonight," he said.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What was in the crate!!! Lol good cliff hanger. Logan wants to know what is in the crate. 
I like the dualistic unpacking off philosophical with the physical unpacking. It is subtle but adds a lot. I wonder what prompted starting both these stories with "Do you ever something because it is the right thing to do?" Good intro and I like it as a way to slide into the action of the scene. 
I think this interaction with the search goes a lot of places, we go to Sarah and a teacher, then sex, then tense sounds in a big bottling plant. I like it, it is fun, but also links two things we have talked about since the beginning of this story, the magic water and Sarah sleeping with a teacher. Also welcome back Sarah, the murdered girl somehow forgotten in the story. Haha. 
Also this is one of the first pieces with no Rodney or Dan, which is good since Michelle and TJ needed some time to be there own contributing characters. 

Questions I had, why was Sarah sad about sex? She seemed thrilled later on anyway? What's the noise they keep hearing? When did Michelle break Mint-EE-Nos-y's nose? Like how many years? *Brad Pitt Voice* What's in the box!!, Is there a thing between Michelle and TJ? They seem sorta, ya know, one touch away from bangin. Dolan Duck banged Sarah? This guy played up for a cartoonishly angry sounding person. Way to go Dolan. I am proud.  
Favorite sentence ""No," Michelle said and tried to keep hey eye roll from sending her into stroke territory." It is so Michelle. And saying and or typing that I realize she is a strong flavorful character that leaves an impression. 

Where to ? This scene is tense towards the end, I can definitely feel the clouds gather as they talk about peeing and sex. I think it has great elements of coming of age stories. 1. Talking about lifes lessons/mysteries (Doing the right thing) 2. Adventurous and perilous scenario (Ominous factory investigating a murder) 3. Sex 4. An unknown threat. 

I think TJ is showing some perceptiveness despite Michelle's low opinion of him, this may be one of those things that turns out to be a surprise ability of his. Or not he can be a doofus and nothing more. But seriously what happens next we wanna know!!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two things everyone knows about Rodney, one he is lazy, second he may have been responsible for the biggest string of monument and statue theft in the county. He denies all association with the two week disappearance of six large works of art surrounding townhall. He was never formally interviewed by the police, but deputy Beau Kinkade hinted that Rodney may have been a suspect. Many people are certain of his guilt and I, Jimmy Green, will lay out the case for my Journalism essay in local public interest.

First I will establish that the subject had a clear motive. Let me take you back to just before the homecoming cookout of 1982. Rodney had just become a freshmen at Minteenosee High and already he was causing trouble. He had been sent to the principles office four times for: Sleeping in class, stealing Mrs. Buckets name plate, flinging grapes at Michelle Hutchins and harrassing the PE coach by making lewd noises mimicking farts. Finally, when Rodney was caught with Mrs. Buckets name plate for a second time Principle Duck had enough. He, with consent of his mother sentenced Rodney to the after school detention reparations program. Which is the official name of the program known to the students as TTO, or trash time out. Some students have accused the school of violating child labor laws by forcing minors to clean the school grounds, but it remains a popular punishment for the misbehaving pupils. Rodney hated the assignment mostly because he was placed under coach Alders who shouted blustering orders from a rolling chair on the side walk.

"You can barely stand, how about you roll down here and get some exercise Russ?" Rodney said one Tuesday afternoon to a red faced Coach Alders.

"That's coach Alders to you hooligan!" Alders blubbered. Rodney, according to witness accounts, rolled his eyes set down his bucket of garbage and then punted Coaches 64 oz Champions thermos and then walked off at a slow pace. Coach gave chase but got winded and called after Rodney.

The next day Principle Duck and coach Alders met and devised an appropriate punishment. Cleaning Duck park in front of city hall. They called Rodneys mother to plan. Early morning the day of homecoming Rodney, Coach Alders, Rodneys mother Ursula, and Principle Duck gathered in the park. By all accounts coach and Duck followed Rodney barking orders and nit picking his cleaning performance. Rodney complained loudly.

"Did you bring it ?" Alders asked a large cheeky grin after Rodney had been working for thirty minutes.

"Huh, uh, Yeah" Ursula said between drags of Paul Mall. With that Rodney's mother produced a bright green toothbrush. Principle Duck looked on admiringly as the assorted Duck monuments were cleaned thoroughly by a deeply disgruntled Rodney.

Two girls walked by and one of them, Michelle immediately called put to Rodney.

"Yuck is that your toothbrush dirtbag? You owe that statue an apology!" The story of Rodney cleaning the statues spread. Most students started calling Rodney Michaelangelo. When Lenny Cresner, a small, meek and socially outcast boy started in picking on Rodney, they say, something snapped.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love the format.  And the addition of the new characters.  I like how we keep building on each otherâs stuff.  Principal Duck is a great choice because there is only one Duck chosen one per generation so what do you do with the rest of the working age Ducks?  You put them in positions of no power (board of directors at the water factory) or where the only damage they can do is to the future of the entire town (I.e., school administrator, destroying the potential of children, etc).  

I think you should take Greenâs stuff even further.  Michelleâs insults come from her super power observation abilities.  To me greenâs would come from having the worlds longest memory and an epic gossip network.  He should have little asides like âLenny Cresner, an alleged bet wetter until the 6th grade...). Just like little digs.  And I think he should totally have Duck hero worship.  You have it in there but I would blow it up even more with Green talking about things duck does that are boarding on total abuse of power but green âreinterprets them as âhumorous anecdotesâ or really shifts blame onto Rodney for things that are totally out of line of Duckâs part.  Like a bit from green about how âthose amazing Duck monuments, legacy and lineage of this great town shown like diamond or star in the dying evening light.â   Essentially the Ducks have the media in their pocket.  It will come in handy later when it all starts to hit the fan and information keeps getting suppressed.

I like Minteenosee. I just love that word now and how the demigod is trying to find ways to soften or obscure what is literally a horrible name.

Also I think you should add in something like how the detective said Rodney was a suspect after green continuously badgered him just so green would leave him alone.  Also I would have green be a total asskisser.  Even though the coach is fat I would make Rodney be the one green says was âblubberingâ.  

Plus green can have fluid alliances.  Who ever he is writing about at that moment is the scum of the earth even though he may have just published a piece where they were the hero of the town (except for the Ducks who are always perfect). I see green a little like Smithers from the Simpsonsâtotally almost cultishly views his boss.

Good work I would just take it even farther into yellow journalism.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Did I ever tell you about Stagwell Meckar?" Doyle said as he waved to one of the stewards for another bourbon.

He and Harry were sitting at the Doyle's club in plush chairs near the fire.Â  A small cluster of empty glasses sat on the drink table next to his chair.Â  The steward mimed pouring a glass and pointed at Harry.Â  Harry shook his head.

"No, not that I recall," Harry said then he said suddenly.Â  "Those men are going to die, aren't they, Arthur?Â  The ones whose cargo we dumped into the ocean."

Doyle stared into the fire.Â  The steward brought Doyle's drink.Â  He did not clear the empty glasses from the table.Â  Doyle liked to mark time by the glasses.Â  He waited until the stewardhad retreated out of earshot.

"Stagwell, we called him 'The Stag'.Â  He was one of my boys.Â  Came in as a transfer."Â  Doyle settled back into the chair and propped a foot on a nearby stool.Â  "Yes, Harry, those smugglers will most likely be killed.Â  If they figure out that we dumped it into the sea they might get away with a severe beating.Â  They can blame it on a rival gang of smugglers.Â  It depends on whose cargo it was.Â  Sometimes only a beating for failure or maybe some of the men will die and some will not.Â  It is hard to know."

Harry downed his bourbon in a single swallow, grimaced, and waved for another.Â  The two sat silent while Harry's drink was prepared and brought over.

"You can take these, Reg," Doyle said to the steward.Â  "This one is my last." He held up his glass.

"Very good, sir," the steward said.

"You were in the war, Reg, yes?" Doyle asked.

The steward nodded.Â  Nothing in the club was off limited to members, including the pasts of the staff.

"Did you know Private, first class, Stagwell Meckar?" Doyle asked.

"I do not believe I ever made his acquaintance, sir."Â  Harry noted that the steward avoided making any comment on whether that was a good or bad thing.Â  Experienced, Harry thought.Â  He has dealt with officers deep in their cups before.

"Thank you, Reg," Doyle said.Â  The steward jumped on the opportunity to exit before Doyle could pull him into listening to a story.Â  Doyle was notorious for wrapping up a 'captive audience' for an hour or more sometimes.

"Drink that one slow, Harry,"Â  Doyle said.Â  He pulled off his shoe and then used his toes to pry off the shoe on the foot resting on the stool.Â  He swirled the golden liquid in his glass, slowly warming it.

"Stag was a coward," Doyle continued.Â  "Complete waste as a soldier.Â  The shooting would start--it never stopped actually, always a few rifles going off somewhere.Â  But it would start in earnest, and as sure as the sun rising, Stag would be huddled in some recess, rifle discarded in the mud, gripping his helmet.Â  Terrified of getting shot in the head." Doyle chuckled.Â  "Did you know he tried to wear two helmets once?Â  He would have crawled on the ground in the filth if I had left him to his druthers."

"That is a horrible story, Arthur.Â  Thank you for sharing," Harry said.Â  "I feel much better about potentially murdering those men."

Doyle scowled at him.Â  "There is a message in this story for you, Harry."

"Arthur, can you move straight to that?Â  I would like to go about getting drunk now."

"Fine.Â  The moral of the story is: So it did stop for a time.Â  Not long mind you, but we were grateful all the same."Â  Doyle took a sip from his glass and leaned back and closed his eyes.

The placement of the chair slightly obscured Doyle's face at that angle.Â  Harry squeezed his unoccupied hand in frustration.Â  His mind was already working on the puzzle, twisting it.Â  Who was grateful?Â  Why were they grateful?Â  Of what were they grateful?Â  Did this Stag--

Harry sighed and set his glass down on the table near his chair.Â  "Please continue, Arthur."

"Are you sure, Harry?"

Harry could almost feel the smile radiating off Doyle's hidden face.Â  He waited.Â  Patience was one skill few could match him in.Â  Eventually, Doyle sat up.Â  He reached over and took the glass out of Harry's hand.Â  "Give me that," he grumbled.Â  "You are about as fun as a car full of old nuns."

"Stagwell?" Harry prompted.

"Big man," Doyle said.Â  The 'story teller' was gone.Â  Now he was just reciting facts.Â  Harry ignored the brusque tone knowing Doyle would fall back into his story teller's mode quickly.

"Big," Doyle continued.Â  "When he rotated in we were all at first delighted.Â  A bullet will kill a big man the same as a small one, but a large presence in the trench settles the boys' nerves a bit.Â  That lasted about twenty minutes.Â  Until the first rounds began flying.Â  Stag pissed himself right there. Standing right there in front of the whole squad.Â  Then he was shoving himself into the smallest crevice he could find.Â  It looked like an elephant trying to fit into a mouse hole."

Doyle took a long sip of one of the bourbons he was holding.Â  "Everyone hates a bloody coward."

"You told me all men are cowards in war," Harry said.

Doyle stared at the two drinks he was swirling.Â  "Yes, I suppose I did.Â  Cowards.Â  Which is why we all hated him."Â  He set them down on the table.Â  He signaled for the steward to remove them.Â  Harry raised a finger when the steward grabbed his drink off Doyle's table but then lowered it.Â  Doyle was done drinking which meant everyone was done drinking.

They stood and headed towards the lobby.Â  Behind them the steward waived for the two men's coats and hats to be retrieved.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel this story has a nice meandering tone at times which makes it feel like a long road trip. This story felt like a stop off at a convenience store. I like how the banter between Harry and Doyle flows, it is familiar and engaging. The setting of the two sipping scotch by a fireplace seems so appropriate. It is easy to picture the two there. Picking up from the last story with the dumping of cargo is a nice transition. I did get the sense that Doyle forgot about protecting Harry's mental state in this continuation, which makes sense due to his drunkenness. I wonder, what made Doyle think of Stagwell? 
Something I see at times, is that you appear to really like Doyle and it makes many of the stories center around him. I think it is a good thing, my thought with that is, how can you make Doyle move the plot? Is there some ulterior motive he has for spending so much time with Harry? What are his vices that he will overcome? What lesson if any will Doyle learn?
I ask those questions because I think you want more story centered around Doyle but Harry has the central conflict. Perhaps Doyle has some other plot point that he is dealing with. Just a thought, you could write some of Doyle's time in the war in present tense. It could unfold as though he is dealing with the psychological affects of his direct conflict in war through this mystery and investigation. Not so much ptsd type dealing with conflict, more like philosophical sorting. As always love the dialogue and word-smithing.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[They stood and headed towards the lobby.Â  Behind them the steward waived for the two men's coats and hats to be retrieved.

Outside the club, Harry followed Doyle through the blisteringly cold wind.Â  He kept a hand on his hat to keep it from blowing off his head.Â  Doyle stalked more than strolled as if he was a battleship plowing through the waves intent on some target.Â  Eventually, Doyle led him into a small opening along the side of a crumbling stone wall.Â  A few teenagers lounged inside the small recess, trying to look tough and unconcerned.

"Take a walk, boys," Doyle said, gesturing toward the snow and whistling wind outside the entrance.

"Wha?" said one of the boys, standing.Â  "You Mary's 're bent if ya think we're giving ya this cave and goin' out there."

Harry took a step back.Â  There were five boys, slowly coming out of their forced languid poses now that their leader had stepped forward and set the tone.Â  Doyle drunk, trying to outwalk war memories, and faced with five sneering targets was a bad combination Harry had seen a number of times.

Doyle stared intently into young tough's eyes.Â  To his credit the boy lost his bravado but he did not back down.Â  Doyle looked out of the opening as if seeing the snow for the first time.Â  After a moment, he nodded.Â  "Fine.Â  Sit."

Harry was as shocked that the boy still had all of his teeth as the boy was that he had been so summarily dismissed.Â  The boy opened his mouth to speak and Harry corrected his thought to "had all of the teeth he had when he and Doyle had entered".

"You--" the boy started.

"SIT!!" Doyle roared.Â  Inside the small space his voice boomed and reverberated like a crack of thunder.Â  The five boys jumped back as one and planted themselves on the small bench near the wall they had been lounging on.Â  Harry had not thought the leader's mouth could have opened any wider but it had.Â  He looked like he was waiting for a dentist to go in with both hands to work on his yellow-stained teeth.

Doyle stepped forward and made a parting motion with his hands.Â  The boys traded unsure glances then their leader gestured for some of the boys to slide down.Â  Doyle grunted then sat down on the bench in the open space.Â  Harry remained standing.

Doyle took out one of his cigars and began to light it.Â  "I let my boys beat on Stagwell.Â  I hated him as much as they did.Â  Maybe more.Â  Boys do not really know how to hate until they become men."Â  He took a long drag and filled the small space with smoke.Â  Harry waved what came at him towards the door, but the boys on the did not move a muscle.Â  Instead they stared at Doyle with unease and awe.

"They beat Stagwell.Â  Tortured him in small ways.Â  Usually small," Doyle continued.Â  He stared at the ground and chewed on the cigar.Â  "You are so scared, Harry.Â  So scared.Â  You hide it.Â  Deal with it.Â  Cover it.Â  But you never showed...Â  Stagwell, he..."Â  Doyle trailed off.

For a few minutes there was only the sound of the wind screaming outside the opening.

"He what?" said the boy beside Doyle said softly.Â  Doyle's head snapped around, anger coloring his features, then after a moment his face softened.Â  He stared intently at the boy, the leader.Â  "He was your age, boy, I think.Â  Bigger than Dobbs even, Harry.Â  Some recruiter made a pretty penny on him to be sure."Â  Doyle's eyes bored into the young leader's as he spoke.Â  "He cried.Â  Sobbed all the time.Â  He sounded..." Doyle's voice caught slightly.Â  "...like...a little boy."Â  Doyle took another deep drag on his cigar and let the smoke curl out of his mouth.

"Horrible things," Doyle whispered.Â  "Did horrible things, they did.Â  And I let them."Â  Doyle leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.Â  "One day," Doyle slapped his hands together creating a reverberating clap.Â  "He stopped crying.Â  He stopped and stood up from the mud.Â  Mortars that day, I remember.Â  Even I was tucked into the bloody walls.Â  He stands up, picks up his rifle and flings it out of the trench."Â  Doyle made a saluting motion.Â  "Gives me a salute and climbs up the ladder to No Man's Land." Â  Doyle shook his head slightly.

"He die?" asked one of the boys.

Doyle chuckled.Â  "Did he ever!Â  Did he ever!"Â  Doyle stood up and began marching in place.Â  "I climbed up to see it.Â  Everyone did.Â  The other side opened on him.Â  Rifles, machine guns, everything they had.Â  They had their own suicides, too.Â  They were happy to oblige young Stagwell's request."Â  Doyle stopped marching in place.Â  "We all ducked back because bullets were flying and ricocheting.Â  Then it slowed and we poked our heads up.Â  And there is.Â  That big bloody bastard standing up tall, arms out even." Doyle put his arms out like he was offering a hug.Â  "Waiting patiently."

"Once in a while men died like that.Â  Standing in place, coming up the ladders in a charge.Â  You had to pull them down or the other side would spend the week practicing on them."Â  Doyle mimed raising a rifle.Â  He pointed it at each boy slowly, sighting down the imaginary barrel.Â  "When the other side fires at you, you can see the flash.Â  Just for an instant."Â  Doyle let the imaginary rifle come to a stop trained on the boy to the leader's left.Â  He mimed pulling the trigger then dropped his hands.

"I never wanted to be killed by a machine gun.Â  So plebian.Â  Ten off you see the same flash.Â  Bloody rude if you ask me.Â  Making a man share his last terrifying moment with someone else.Â  Like realizing that all of your best men at your wedding are actually marrying your bride as well that day."Â  Doyle turned to Harry.Â  "No, that did not happen to me."

One of the boys snickered.Â  Doyle walked back and sat down.Â  He took a drag on his cigar then carefully put it out and returned it to his coat pocket.Â  "I really do hate bourbon."

"Why drink it?" Harry asked.

"Because that is what rich bastards do!" Doyle yelled.

He settled back and looked up and down the line of boys.Â  "How old are you?" he asked one.

"Eighteen," the boy said, then as Doyle's scowl. "Fourteen."

Doyle scratched his chin.Â  "Yes, I think The Stag must have been about your age.Â  Someone lied to get him in.Â  Though we needed new bodies all the time so I doubt anyone looked hard."

"Maybe he was a criminal," said one boy.

"That's the bloody French Foreign Legion, you idiot," Doyle snapped.Â  "We kept all of our criminals in the British government so that we could keep an eye on them."

The leader of the boys pulled out a small flask and handed it to Doyle.Â  "It's not bourbon."

Doyle eyed the flask skeptically but took it.Â  He opened it and sniffed the contents.Â  His nose wrinkled but he took sip.Â  He grimaced.Â  "This is definitely not bourbon."Â  Then he shrugged, took a long drink, grimaced again then handed it back to the boy.Â  "Not bad really."Â  The boy smiled slighly and tucked the flask away.

Doyle started to stand.

"Wait," said one boy.Â  "What about Stag?"

"The Stag," Harry corrected.

"Oh," Doyle said leaning back again into the wall.Â  "They shot at him again.Â  And again.Â  I heard at least one machine gunner call for a reload.Â  Nothing.Â  Not even a scratch on Stagwell.Â  Then they stopped."

"Stopped?" said one boy incredulously.Â  "Stopped?"

Doyle nodded.Â  "Stagwell, gets tired of waiting.Â  Drops his jacket.Â  His shirt was still white, sweat stained but white.Â  Never took off the jacket since he arrived, I realize then.Â  He starts walking across No Man's Land.Â  And--"

"They started shooting?" said another boy.

"No, we did," Doyle said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["What!?" Harry said.&nbsp; "You shot at your own man?"

"Not me specifically," Doyle grumbled.&nbsp; "The boys did.&nbsp; Up and down the line the boys did.&nbsp; Everyone hated him, Harry.&nbsp; Incessant crying.&nbsp; What if he came back down the ladder?"

Harry crossed his arms.&nbsp; "You let your men kill one of their own so that he--"

"He was killing us!" Doyle screamed.&nbsp; "Bloody killing us, Harry!&nbsp; He sounded like...he sounded like...like everything that was good dying.&nbsp; Everyone shooting at him.&nbsp; Them, my boys, men up and down the trench lines, both sides."&nbsp; Doyle took a deep breath.&nbsp; "Nothing.&nbsp; Not a scratch.&nbsp; He walked to some scraggly tree, sat down against it and died on his own, without all of our help."

"Just like that?" asked a boy.&nbsp; "He died?&nbsp; Without a bullet in him?"

"Yes," Doyle said simply.&nbsp; Everyone waited, but he was silent.

"How do you know it weren't a bullet?" asked the leader of the boys.&nbsp; "You were far off."

Doyle shrugged.&nbsp; "Because I searched him from head to toe."

"They let you retrieve his body?" Harry asked.&nbsp; He had his head cocked slightly to the side.&nbsp; Nothing Doyle had ever said about his experiences in the War spoke of even basic civility.

Doyle shrugged.&nbsp; "Eventually, everyone stopped shooting.&nbsp; He was mine, sort of, so I raised the white flag and went out to check Stagwell for holes.&nbsp; One of the German officers did the same.&nbsp; We met at Stagwell's body.&nbsp; Stripped him completely while the whole world waited."

"And?" Harry prompted.

"And he was untouched.&nbsp; Not a scratch," Doyle shifted uncomfortably.&nbsp; "Other than what my boys did to him before he went up that ladder.&nbsp; But that was only some bruising."

"Was it your German?" Harry asked.

"Yes," Doyle said.&nbsp; "He helped me bury Stagwell by the tree.&nbsp; We put the truce flags on top of the grave to mark it."

Doyle lapsed into silence again, then said, "Stag's Road we called that place.&nbsp; The Germans had a name, too, but I cannot recall it.&nbsp; No one shot into that place." Doyle chuckled softly.&nbsp; "No one shot anywhere for a few days.&nbsp; See, we both used up most of our munitions trying to kill that bloody bastard.&nbsp; So up and down the lines for a couple thousand yards, none of the officers put in supply requisitions.&nbsp; We just stopped. Stopped fighting."

"You could have been overrun," said one boy.&nbsp; The others nodded solemnly.

Doyle looked up and down the line.&nbsp; "Your fathers were in the War?"&nbsp; The boys all nodded.&nbsp; "Came back?"

The boys traded uncomfortable glances then looked at their feet.

"Most of them," said the boy's leader.&nbsp; "Not the same, though."

Doyle scanned the little cave's ceiling and nodded slightly.&nbsp; "Yes, that is true for a lot of men."

"How long did the fighting stop?" Harry asked.

"Three days.&nbsp; Three days and four nights.&nbsp; Third day, I met with the Germans and told them someone had noticed a thousand Brits and Scots missing from the War and came to see what was happening.&nbsp; Similar story with them, though, they were low on everything then so it took them an extra day to get munitions.&nbsp; We gave them until noon to get restocked then got back to killing each other."

"The War stopped for three and a half days?" Harry asked.

"Not all of it," Doyle said.&nbsp; "Just a small piece of it."&nbsp; He pointed a finger at Harry.&nbsp; "Men die.&nbsp; Sometimes good men, most times not good men.&nbsp; Good things come without warning.&nbsp; A flower pops up on a battlefield.&nbsp; No one knows why.&nbsp; We did good tonight, Harry.&nbsp; In spite of what happens to a few bad men, we did good."

Doyle stood and removed his jacket.&nbsp; He turned to the boys and began rolling up his sleeves.&nbsp; "Now, how about I teach you how to actually defend this little refuge from Hell."&nbsp; The boys looked at each other, then slowly stood up.&nbsp; Doyle waved two of the boys over and indicated the rest to step back and make room.

"Right.&nbsp; Now we will go slowly, gentlemen, to preserve your ugly little visages.&nbsp; If anyone takes a real swing you will feel the back of my hand so go bloody slow. When your mothers come to me in the night I want it to be for the right reasons and not to cut my throat while I sleep."&nbsp; Doyle corrected one boy's foot placement.&nbsp; "You, hands up, no not like that.&nbsp; Keep one up like this to protect your head, good, elbow out to catch an overhand.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Now, this one is for your body..."

Harry sat down on the bench and leaned back and closed his eyes.&nbsp; There was a loud slap but he ignored it.

"I said to bloody go slowly.&nbsp; Save your savagery for the enemy," Doyle growled.&nbsp; "Now, come in slow, slower, turn your fist slightly.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Straight wrist.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Right, next two men up.&nbsp; Stances, fists up.&nbsp; Good."&nbsp; Slap.&nbsp; "I said bloody slowly.&nbsp; Tuck your chin there.&nbsp; Left foot forward on the jab.&nbsp; Your other left foot, idiot! Good! Now, I want you to..."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This really shaped up! I may have missed the group of boys showing up, but I really like Doyle's mentoring and story telling. I like how callous he is about some things, like when he is like yea, we shot at Stagg because we was annoying. The way he fumbles a bit explaining makes the dialogue really have texture. I wonder where Harry was for the war? Do they ever talk about it?
So meeting one for Doyle and his German friend. I am interested how they meet again, or if they do before ya know ending up in Hell together.... It has sequel all over it. 
I like this war stopping because they all witness something strange. It has a super natural feeling all the while being relatable. I think this story has that sort of duality, it follows super analytical curious men, full of life, who encounter something terrible and they stop what they are doing to look at something strange. But then like Doyle at the end of this story they proceed back to hitting one another, carrying on because they think they ought to. I like the slapping we hear. hahaha. So why did they dump the loot? I feel like Doyle is a man with ulterior motives! I really feel this whole world, with every new story I get a little further into the foggy London stomping grounds of Harry and Doyle. I kept waiting for Dobbs to chime in! lol. Also where is Bess?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rodney is not someone who holds the door open for people. He does help little old ladies across the street. He spit into Coaches cola every day for a month just to see if he would notice. Someone who is so disagreeable when no discernible wrong has been done, is much more likely to be criminally disagreeable when action is taken against them. When Rodney was forced to clean statues in front of his peers he loudly seethed.

"You are gonna regret this Duck! These dusty old awards your family gave yourself aren't worth the bird crap covering them." Rodney yelled after Conner Matthews skateboarded by holding an L on is forehead with his thumb and forefinger . To you dear reader, who may be unfamiliar with gesture it is a hip way youths let others know they think they are a loser. The "L" made with the fingers stands for loser.

After Rodney's tirade in front of a gathering crowd Principle Duck walked towards Rodney to sternly and quietly reprimand him. "Waddle away Duck!" Rodney shouted holding up the aforementioned gesture of thumb and forefinger. Rodney mother clicked her mouth at him and pointed at him with a cigarette in between her fingers. "That is not the way that Buzz and I raised you!" Ursula said in a well rehearsed and performed single line of highly telling parenting. It is believed by some of the local children that Rodneys real dad is unknown to him and that his mother chose celebrity astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, as a rouse. It is unknown if Rodney is aware Buzz Aldrin is not his real father.

A bright green flash of plastic could be seen sailing through the air. Those that saw it happen said it was like time stood still. Everyone got quiet just in time to hear the impact of toothbrush on statue. Rodney stood frozen watching with everyone else as the impact landed. What harm could a toothbrush do to the statue of Minteenosee? Well I will tell you, it is not about the physical damage but the intent. Everyone in town loves that statue, it is a shining beacon representing our town. Even people who come to visit the town say they are drawn to it. How could some one defile something that means so much to so many? Well he was, in my opinion, just getting started.

After the projectile was recovered and damage assessed Rodney was chewed out in front of the crowd. Lenny the small boy of ill-repute threw at stick at Rodney and no one called him down for it. Mrs. Kerry, the sweet old window who knits scarves for needy people flipped Rodney off while the preacher watched. Rodney's mother shook her head and according to some close by repeated "We didn't raise him like dat."

Rodney looked out onto the disproving onlookers and lifted a resolute finger. "You love that stupid statue so much? What would you losers do if lost your precious Men-tee-noss-y?" He butchered the name of the beloved town statue. He displayed a blatant disregard for a revered piece of community history and culture. And it is my belief he decided in that moment to commit a heinous crime.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I almost peed myself over the Buzz Aldrin bit.  Then I thought wait what if Rodneyâs secret genius thought through it analyzed Buzzâs life and his known movements, his momâs etc. and determine there was a decent enough probability that it could be true. 

It would be funny if Rodneyâs father was really Neil Armstrong but whenever one of Neilâs âparamours for the nightâ asked his name Neil would say âBuzz Aldrinâ just in case...

I think guy should write also the entire piece from rodneyâs perspective.  Give it a totally different interpretation.  Like in Rodneyâs story he thinks he is volunteering to clean the statue and all the same things are said but he laughs off harsh stuff as jokes etc.  And in Rodneyâs version of the story Connor Matthews is doing the âLâ at Jimmy Green.

I think the statue thing you should play up.  Jimmy Green says Rodney urinates on the statue but according to Rodney he had something in his pocket that exploded as he tried to catch the tooth brush etc.

I like where youâre taking Rodney and also how we continue to flesh out the world / town with these little shorts.  

And nice weaving in the âdrawn toâ the status line.  Subtle magic, subtle writing ð]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Corruption is a strong word. Too strong really for what happened in the race for mayor. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In fact one could argue that it was barely corruption. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In fact, one could argue the townâs election laws were poorly written and this minor incident of wide spread voter fraud was a good thing for showing those legal flaws. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In fact, perhaps the town owes a debt of gratitude to the incumbent mayor for his creative ballot counting method...</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>â Pineallis P. Rutherford, Mayor (Incumbent) writing as Don Ju-wan (Opinion Editor, Sky Blue Sun newspaper)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI am telling you it is voter fraud!  Ballot box stuffing!â Ernie Smith yelled.  He slammed his fist down on the Council table.  Ernie turned a baleful eye on the assembled crowd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo one is disputing a few irregularities, Ernie,â Mayor Rutherford said, flashing a set of perfectly straight, brilliant white teeth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOne hundred percent of the vote?â Ernie spat.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMaybe you filled out your own ballot sheet wrong, Ernie,â Sheila Moor offered.  She was an At-Large-Council member.  She was beholden to no specific constituency so she felt the need to act as the peacemaker.  Usually there was no need for oneâthe town practically ran itselfâso she was relishing this opportunity to actually make peace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAnd my wife?â Ernie asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rutherford propped a pair of dirty cowboy boots onto the table. The boots clashed slightly with his bath robe. âSounds like an issue at home.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ernie Smith took three long, deep breaths. âYes, dead 5 years now, yet,â he held up a sheet of paper and flapped it at the assembled audience, âhere is her vote filled out for Pineallis and dated for yesterday.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few council members looked around the room uncomfortably, but most just nodded their head.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWho can know the mind of the dead,â Rutherford said sympathetically. He reached forward and flicked some manure off the toe of one of his boots.  It landed in the center of the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPre-dead,â Councilman Faldo said. âI think the correct term is âpre-deadâ.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rachel Caldwell, another council member, rolled her eyes. âWe are all pre-dead, Chester.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAnd in this town by God we count every vote, pre-dead or post-dead.  Even dead-head,â Rutherford said.  He chuckled at his own joke.  âDid you write that down?â He asked the council secretary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Millie Newberry looked up from a scattered pile of papers, pens and sticky notes.  âWrite what down?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rutherford scowled at her. âCan someone make a motion to write that down in the record?  What I said.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âStop trying to change the subject, Pineallis,â Ernie said.  He turned to the crowd.  âHow many people in here voted for Rutherford?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one in the crowd raised a hand. A few people craned their heads to see if anyone raised their hand at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell, there you have it, Ernie,â Rutherford said. He flashed his smile again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHave what!!?â Ernie said.  âNo one voted for you.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rutherford stood up and grabbed the gavel. âThis isnât communist Russia! We vote by secret ballot for a reason.  To defend liberty and justice for all.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Councilman Faldo nodded vigorously.  âI motion we make a motion to not use communist voting.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSecond,â someone yelled from the audience chamber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou canât second, Milo!â Ernie said.  âYou have to be on the council.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe are motioning for Milo to be on the council?â Millie asked, scribbling furiously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo!â Ernie Smith said.  He yanked at the few strands of hair that clung to his mostly bald head.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAll in favor?â Rutherford asked. He stuck the gavel. âSold! Election results are ratified.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIs âratifiedâ one word or two?â Millie, the council secretary asked as Ernie Smith stormed out of the hall, muttering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAnd take your commie votes with you,â someone from the crowd yelled at Ernieâs back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFine, fine. Fine work,â Rutherford said. He banged the gavel again for good measure. Then again. âLetâs break for lunch.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is very nice with all the commotion of recent times to duck back into this world we have been forging. I like this scene, a small town with small town corruption clear and present but many people are too simple or unwilling to see it. The more I think about our story I think about how it is really the small towns that have died. The mayor seems like a man who would work with shady characters. Maybe even shady deities... I think this scene shows how it would be feasible for gods to exist and hide among the bureaucracy. I think the is ratified one word or two is a great indicator of the caliber of person running this town Maybe Ernie could be one of the few people that recognizes weirdness in town... or someone could fill that roll. A local reporter type. 
I a curious about the pre dead, post dead and dead head. Is that part of the law all persons alive or dead can vote? So we just had a mayoral campaign, I wonder if there are any divine appointed initiatives the local government is undertaking. I like opening with a quote, that could be a fun device to play with... 
I always get such a transportive rhythm from your writing, I can see the room filled with older people in brightly colored 80's attire a few with thick rimmed copper glasses hanging from beaded lanyards. Lingering sticky styrofoam cups of coffee sitting on folding tables. I can picture because your ability to make memorable scenes is so poignant. I think I know Millie Newberry and she hardy spoke. But I know where she fits. your writing gracefully suggest some stereotype with precise context. 
I think once all this nonsense blows over we should do a marathon writing session just ping ponging ideas and writing them as they come. Hope you are well.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Reed Green is a hunter. He wears camo to all occasions and wears shooting glasses in place of sunglasses. He is a man who behaves in a way that says he is terrified someone may be unsure of his hobby. Every morning of deer season he wakes at four thirty, drinks a black cup of coffee and smears himself brown green doe piss in that order. He wades out into the forest and climbs a small ladder overlooking a field on his fathers land. Hours pass in cool silence but he remains wide awake, eyes darting at every lizard sneeze or chipmunk fart.

One morning out on his stand a little before five o'clock in the morning he had a strange experience. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a dim figure outlined in the dark. The shape moved in and out of perception undulating under waves a deep blue morning gloom. He raised his rifle and peered down the scope. The shade of color deepened on and off, like it was going far away and coming back suddenly. It may be a twelve pointer, he thought considering the figures head on his bedroom wall. His eyes narrowed and he brought his finger to the trigger.

"Where is he!?" Reed heard a accented voice in the darkness. Reed let out a tight breath as he relaxed his finger. Still keeping it resting on the trigger guard. Who was out here? Big Steve? Little Robert? Krazy Kathleen? He didn't recognize the voice and he wasn't fond of foreign talk. Reed decided to keep quiet.

"There you are you dick! It's freezing out here, why the hell couldn't we have just met at Pearl's? It smells like goat piss out here"

The voice from the darkness asked in a un place able but think accent. "Shhhh!" A second gravely voice retorted. "We are out here with just the animals. I needed to be sure, in town there is too much tal (as in mortal) smell. Here I can know, no tal, no cousins." Reed wondered what kind of commie bullshit was taking place and tried to keep his breath slow and silent.

"I got it" The grovely voice said in a low but gleeful tone.

"got what? " The first voice said flatly.

"You stupid fuck, the answer to your question?!" The grovely voice shouted in a whisper.

"Wh.."

"Don't say what question, the fuckin expansion shit you and me talked about." The groveler grumbled.

"I was shit faced Thrumble, you took that seriously?"

"keep ya voice down you stupid tit, yeah serious Minty. You and I both know we need an infusion, our congregents ain't what the used to be." The voice rumbled like two rocks jostled together.

"Yeah, of course. We known that. Why the hell can't we just talk bout it at pearls?" The first voice inquired.

"Cuz we gotta break tha law?" A low gravely whisper rumbled.

"So?" The accent accented.

"Not their law, we gotta break the scroll code."

"Literally Hell no!"

"Hear me out, it is more of a circumversion of tha law. I have been talking with my brother, Verhumroro, he says that..." The grumble voice said leaning close to the other voice in the dim light. " There was a case where wajic was used to destroy a parks congregants, but the big dogs said it don't count cuz it was one towns tals dat used the wajic. Some fuckin culties got some jackass cousins diary or somethin."

"Fuck, I am not trying to get any big cousin lookin at me. Christmas has it out for me... I told him I preferred Dewa Solstice at the picnic sixty years ago."

"You gotta grow a pair Minty, else ya gonna be forgotten. Also and don't get mad, I already gave your tals some wajic scribbles."

Reed exhaled, but couldn't breath right and coughed a bit. He listened for the voices for a long time but heard only the tiny squeak of a chipmunks anus.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Looks like I can put in comments in a web browser but not through the WordPress app.  Go figure. 

Love Reed.  Everyone knows someone like him.  Doesn't need to be a hunter-type.  It can be a jock, or geek, or something where the person accrues things or words or mannerisms to give themselves an identity.  Your stuff always has at least a touch of cerebral in it so I have been turning over in my mind why of all people it's Reed who overhears the two demi-gods talking.  Is it luck?  Or is it because he has always had good hearing.  Like maybe he WANTS to be a hunter.  He can get everything right even down to covering himself in deer piss except actually taking a shot when he has one.  There is always something (subconsciously self inflicted) that happens to make him miss.  Or maybe he never takes the shot.  It never lines up perfectly.  He has fired thousands of rounds at targets of every shape of animal he can buy or make.  But he just can't shoot a living being.

On the demis I am glad you pulled in some plot.  We are kind of meandering through the story, a lot of it character driven (like Catch-22) so a good dose of plot helps re-focus and give everything a direction.  I like the use of the word "congregants".  It has a much more old world feel than "followers" or "disciples", much more unique (and for some reason I started to write the word "unquiet" and backspaced it then thought somehow it fit too though I am not sure why...  Much more unquiet?)  So yeah good plot push there.

I think the other demi-god should ask Minty Nose about feeling the loss/lack of power.  Something just for them to discuss and write the rules of the world/do world building.  The other town's demi-god seems more powerful but still a D list demigod.  Maybe an F list where Minty is an H list threatening to fall into a I list or something like that.  Maybe not spelled out as A-list etc but that type of concept.  Also the other demigod has to have a motivation for helping Minty.  And also one for being just slightly above Minty's punching weight.  Is he secretly trying to take over Minty's territory?  Is he trying to get Minty to get busted so that he can annex the town or have all the residents move over to his town?  Etc.  

Good piece though.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Doyle grunted as he pulled his bag over the steam pipe barring his way.&nbsp; It was an evil pipe and its brethren had banged his shins and tripped him up more times that he could count.

"A'right, sir?" Dobbs asked.&nbsp; Doyle gave him a venomous stare at which Dobbs gave him a wink and trudged on ahead.&nbsp; Doyle, pipe cleared, reshouldered his burlap sack with as much of dignity as he could muster.

Dobbs was easily carrying two large sacks, twice the size of Doyle's.&nbsp; He had one slung over each shoulder but would transfer them both to a single hand periodically to offer a hand to Doyle or Harry when the were trying to scale a particularly dangerous pipe or cross a flimsy plank.&nbsp; In that moment, Doyle hated Dobbs as he had hated no other man in his...well, that night.&nbsp; Harry was coming a close second on Doyle's hate list though.&nbsp; His bag was definitely smaller than Doyle's and he also had that stupid manic grin back.

"Do you feel like the walls are closing in?" Harry asked cheerfully.

Doyle looked around.&nbsp; "Not until you just said it, Harry," he said in even measured tones.&nbsp; "Thank you for your leadership," he added with as much spite as his manage in his current exhausted state.

"Not me, sir," Dobbs called from a few yards up.&nbsp; He had stopped to light a cigarette.

"Don't let those sacks touch the ground!" Doyle called, but Dobbs only smiled and raised the two sacks in one hand to show he still had them off the ground.

"I hate him," Doyle muttered.

Harry smiled warmly.&nbsp; "He is very fond of you, Arthur.&nbsp; We both are."

"That is because I am quite bloody fetching," Doyle grumbled.&nbsp; "At least I am when I am not traipsing through underground tunnels with two idiots due to one idiot's bloody idiotic idiot idea.&nbsp; Then I am a real bloody bastard to be around!"

Harry badly attempted to cover a smirk.&nbsp; "Are not all tunnels 'underground' by their very nature?"

"Can I ask ya a question, Mr. Doyle?' Dobbs said.&nbsp; Harry and Doyle had caught up to him.&nbsp; Dobbs took the lead again and talked back over his shoulder as he navigated the tunnels.

Doyle tried to think of a sufficiently biting response, but could come up with nothing.&nbsp; "No," he said after a minute.

The three moved in grunting, cursing silence for a few moments. Sewer grates allowed light in at various junctions. It created the illusion that they walked from pool to pool, their footsteps echoing down the tunnel.

Eventually, Dobbs looked back at Doyle then to Harry. Doyle and Harry exchanged a glance. Harry nodded.

"I could use a brief respite," Harry said.

"No," Doyle grumbled and shifted his shoulders.

Dobbs held out his hand to Harry. "Do yah--"

"No, that bloody idiot can carry his own sack," Doyle said and lumbered forward.&nbsp; Every muscle in his back and arms hurt but he would be damned if that damn ox brain was going to coddle him or Harry.

Dobbs let Harry pass then fell in step behind him. He started to hum slightly.

He made it four bars into the song before Doyle growled, "What's your bloody question, Dobbs?"

Dobbs smiled slightly to himself. Then his face took on a thoughtful expression. "Why did ya kill 'em, Mr. Doyle?"

Harry and Doyle exchanged a look while they tried somewhat unsuccessfully to make it past a series of shin-attacking pipes.

"You obviously are still alive--at least from the neck down and Harry am not planning to kill until we get out of this bloody tunnel. So...why did I kill whom?" Doyle asked as the three worked their way through the maze of pipes.

"Sharlock Homes.&nbsp; The detective," Dobbs said.

"Holmes, you mean? From the book?" Harry asked, shocked. "With words...?"

Dobbs nodded.&nbsp; "Yah, 'im."

Harry said, "I apologize, Dobbs, but, well, it is rather shocking that a man of your, uh, talents--"

"Of course, I read," Dobbs said, offended.&nbsp; "See!" He reached in his coat with his free hand and pulled a worn paperback out of his coat pocket.

Harry took the paperback and turned it over where he could see it by the light filtering in from the street above them.

"Is that a penny dreadful?" Doyle asked, gritting his teeth.

Dobbs took the book back from Harry and waved it in Doyle's face.&nbsp; "No. It's Sharlock Homes.&nbsp; It's yur book, Mr. Doyle," he said very slowly.&nbsp; Dobbs looked at it again as if making sure it was the correct book then shoved it back under Doyle's nose.

Doyle ignored the book, shouldered his bag and angrily stomped forward.&nbsp; "It is not MY book, Dobbs.&nbsp; This is a distilled counterfeit with pictures.&nbsp; It is a book for children.&nbsp; Thieving children, come to think of it."&nbsp; He whirled on Dobbs as fast as a man struggling under such a great weight could.&nbsp; "Did you even pay for that or did you lift it from a book stand?"

Dobbs scrunched up his broad face in thought.&nbsp; "Bought," he said after a moment then gave Doyle and Harry a weak smile.&nbsp; "Ay thank Ay bought it."

"Then you owe me a penny," Doyle roared.&nbsp; "I am taking it out of this week's wage."

"Doyle," Harry said, at the crestfallen look on Dobbs' face.&nbsp; "He is reading your story--"

Doyle started to turn and start walking but after a moment's thought dropped his sack on the ground.&nbsp; "It is bloody thievery, Harry.&nbsp; How would you feel if someone stole your tricks and performed shoddy versions of them?"

Harry shifted his sack while he considered the point.&nbsp; He nodded at Doyle.&nbsp; "Dobbs, you have done a very bad thing.&nbsp; Those Sherlock Holmes (with an 'L' by the way, Dobbs), those Sherlock Holmes stories took a lot of work of Doyle's part.&nbsp; It is a bit like robbing him."

Dobbs looked hurt.&nbsp; "I--"

"I, I, I," Doyle spat.&nbsp; He pointed at the bag at his feet.&nbsp; "You can start your apology by carrying my bag as well, you dumb, thieving lumox!"

Dobbs easily picked up the third bag and tossed it over his shoulder.&nbsp; "Sorry," he said.

Doyle pushed past him.&nbsp; "This tunnel goes on forever.&nbsp; It is like we are stuck in Hell.&nbsp; I am stuck in Hell with two idiots."

They walked in silence for a few minutes while Harry periodically checked a crudely drawn map.

"Dobbs," Harry said, walking a pace behind Dobbs.&nbsp; "You said Holmes died?"

"Yah, went right over a cliff 'e did," Dobbs replied.

"Really?" Harry asked, curious.&nbsp; "In that version in your pocket?"

Suddenly ahead of them Doyle, who had been focusing on not banging his shins, stopped and turned around.&nbsp; "What did you just ask, Harry?"

"I asked--"

Doyle exploded.&nbsp; "You have not read the entire series?!!?&nbsp; Good God, man!&nbsp; Even this dumb ox has read SOME version of the entire story.&nbsp; That is some of my best work!"

"I am sorry, Doyle, but they were beginning to get repetitive," Harry said.&nbsp; Dobbs held out his hand for Harry's bag.&nbsp; Harry handed it over to Dobbs, who added it to the other three on his shoulder.&nbsp; "Thank you, Doyle."

Dobbs nodded then started walking.&nbsp; "Mr. 'arry is not wrong, say," he said.

"You read bloody pictures, you inebriated monkey humping ape," Doyle said.&nbsp; "Harry, are--"

"So he IS dead?&nbsp; Your main character?" Harry asked.

"Went right over a cliff, 'e did," Dobbs said.

"Really?" Harry asked.

"Wait!" Doyle said, "You--bloody Hell!" Doyle had failed to notice Dobbs slight bow to avoid a low hung pipe and hit his head on it.&nbsp; "Bloody! Hell!"

"What do you mean you have not read the last book?" Doyle asked, rubbing the spot where he had hit the pipe.

"I bought them, I just have not had time to read them," Harry said.&nbsp; He pointed at another low hanging pipe.&nbsp; Dobbs caught that one on the head and let out a string of curses.

"I do not bloody well care if you bought the damn book, I want people to read the bloody books." Doyle said.

"Does that mean I still owe you the penny, Mr. Doyle," Dobbs asked.

"Quiet!" Doyle yelled.&nbsp; "And, yes, you do."&nbsp; He turned back to Harry.&nbsp; "Why have you not completed the series?"

"I told you.&nbsp; It just seemed to be getting repetitive," Harry said.&nbsp; "One case after another--"

"He's a detective, you dolt!" Doyle fumed. He stormed ahead a few yards then he slowed for them to catch up.&nbsp; "I killed him because it was the character's story arc.&nbsp; That is what had to happen."

"This is it," Dobbs said, looking up.&nbsp; He pointed at a rickety ladder leading up to what appeared to be a trapdoor in the dim light.&nbsp; He stopped and put a hand on it and shifted the bags so that he could climb up one-handed.&nbsp; Harry and Doyle stopped at the base of the ladder and looked up.

Dobbs paused, his foot on the first step.&nbsp; "So you killed Sharlock--"

"Sherlock," Doyle corrected angrily.

"Shurelock," Dobbs said.&nbsp; "So you killed Shurelock because he wanted to die?"

"Yes, it was his character arc. Let's go," Doyle said, running a hand over his face.&nbsp;

"You were making a lot of money on those books, Doyle," Harry said.

"And they were good, they were," Doyle added helpfully.

Doyle pointed up the ladder. When Harry and Dobbs did not move he sighed.&nbsp; "Fine.&nbsp; I killed him because I was sick of him.&nbsp; Sick to death of him."

"That seems harsh, Mr. Doyle," Dobbs said, softly. "You made 'em. Like he was a son."

Doyle looked back and forth between Dobbs and Harry.&nbsp; "He is a bloody character.&nbsp; He is not real.&nbsp; Who cares if I make him fall over a waterfall?"

Dobbs shrugged.&nbsp; "Sure," he said and started to climb. "But if Sharlock was me boy, I'd do him a better turn."

"Wait," Doyle said testily.&nbsp; "He is not dead."&nbsp; Dobbs raised his eyebrows and paused mid-step.&nbsp; "The publishers," Doyle said with a sigh.&nbsp; "They have been pressuring me for years to bring Holmes back.&nbsp; But dead is dead.&nbsp; When you are dead you do not come back."

The three were silent for a minute then Dobbs shifted the bags and started up the ladder.&nbsp; "'I'ull read 'em proper, Mr Doyle.&nbsp; No pictures.&nbsp; At least the last one where he dies.&nbsp; Mr. Harry will, too. Right, Mr. Harry?"

"Ah...yes, of course,"&nbsp; Harry said.&nbsp; "Especially if Holmes is coming back," he added.&nbsp; "Everyone loves a happy ending."

Doyle nodded.&nbsp; "Don't they just, though."&nbsp; He looked up at the trapdoor Dobbs was making his way towards.&nbsp; "Don't they just."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[From Logan: 

Carl, 
I want you to know that I tortured Coley by reading this one aloud during dinner with what he described as an "awful" cockney accent. Reading Dobb's character makes me laugh out loud. "Sharlock Homes" really showed us who he is. The imagery in this one, especially the mentioning of the pipes at shin-level, was just spot on. Definitely felt like we were lumbering along with the trio underground listening to their squabble. Your homage to our current pandemic was hilarious and sobering at once. It's something that none of us will forget in our lifetimes, and so I really like that you took care to explain how Doyle's experience had such an influence on his own storytelling. 
As a more general note, reading along with Ellory, Murder Club, and Bottom of the Lake shows me not only how much of a fantastic storyteller you are, but also what a distinct style and cadence you write with. That is something that Coley has improved in and learned from writing with you during this past year and a half, I can see it when I read the earlier pieces and then what you both are writing now. You've taught him a ton. Your stories move at the perfect pace and you give the reader the right amount of imagery and information they need to be immersed in the story but not think too far ahead. It's truly excellence. I'm really glad that the two of you have this outlet to create such tangible, emotional stories. I have so much fun reading them.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, Logan!  I am sure your accent was perfect so you tell my co-author I said "#1 Fan is also our only fan.  ASAP you order her flowers and tell her nice things about her shoes."  
Thank you for your kind words and as always thank you for reading the stories.  Both the comments on that specific BotL scene and also the general note really mean a lot to me.  That is not an empty compliment by the way.   I personally put a lot of stock in your reactions, like "a lot" a lot.  You are a part of this as much as Coley and I.

Coley's writing and also the way he approaches the creative process has really impacted how I approach mine so it is a fair exchange of educating for sure.  His work is so cerebral which is something mine tends to lack.  Note that's cerebral in the context that after I finish a piece of his I will sometimes sit there starting at the screen trying map out in my head the implications of an idea he is playing with on the characters and maybe eventually on the readers someday.

Portrait is so strong because he really challenges some stale, but dearly held conventions ("If I knew then what I know now...").  What person doesn't have some at least minor secret desire to go back to a time when they were  younger, stronger, or had less responsibility?  

But then we see Michael--a college age kid--going back into the body of his six, or 10 or high school aged- self.  Michael, a 20-something who knows that high school society is a joke (at least once you leave it), has to force himself into that environment's thought patterns and artificial rules.  So far one of my fav scenes is when Michael goes back to inhabit his 6 year old body and meets Ellory.  She asks him if he likes horses and when he says No, she blows him off because "all of her friends like horses."  Kid logic.  That is the kind of thing that just drives some amazing characterization and plot opportunities.

Coley's argument against a romantic connection between Ellory and Michael makes more sense too now that I think about it in that light.  But (and I shouldn't find this so much fun but I do) it cancels out a position he took in a debate we had last week about nurture vs. nature.  Our bodies--especially in our teenage years--are flooded with hormones.  So from Coley's argument that nature / environment drives human behavior then Michael would have to be struggling NOT to be attracted to Ellory.  Teenage hormones, teenage male body, plus a beautiful, smart, funny girl showing even a modicum of interest in you?  That is enough to make the average teenage guy stand outside a girl's window holding a ghetto blaster above his head playing her favorite song.  (Heck, I once unpacked an entire moving truck I had just spent a day packing because on my last trip to the truck with some boxes some girl I had never met (and never saw again) told me it was too bad I was moving away and then batted her eyes at me.)  That is the power of the look in a woman's eyes of POTENTIAL attraction has on a man in his teens.

Therefore, Nurture / personal core values and experience would be the only thing that could KEEP Michael viewing Ellory as a girl who he only wants as a friend.  My argument that people can create an internal environment or core value to help them resist the pressures of the Nature / outside environment carries the day.  (Check mate, Co-author, if you are reading this.  Check to the freakin mate!!  You can refer to me as "Mr. Carl" until you win the next debate subject or do 25 burpees.)

Coley somehow can open up an entire debate in a reader's mind with a single, subtle plot device (i.e., time travel into your own body).  That is what the best storytellers do so there is definitely an equal exchange of helping the other develop our craft.  And again like I said above you and your reactions and comments are a major part of the writing process in my mind.  Thank you, Logan!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes when you look at someone for a while and really look at them you start to think, who is this person? Michael squinted, analyzing the odd cadence with which she chewed her chicken wrap. He was hoping for some wave of memory to wash over him and fill out this relationship. What he really wanted in that moment was a name. Jane maybe? No, that was the name of the Ellory's aunt who came for thanksgiving but didn't eat anything. Who does that? It could have been a boys name, there was some swirling feeling about someone with a boys name. Charlie? Michael was pretty sure that was on his mind since Zeb had been testing new middle names to claim he had. Why does anyone care about their middle name? It is weird he kept trying to tell us it was something different every week, Allison started writing them down. Zebediah Neal Henry Charlie Ostrich Chauncy Flame Web Dunkin Burger.

The girl across the table looked up and smiled, mouth full of tortilla and chicken. Michael was tired and was having a hard time landing anywhere certain. It is like when you wake up from a dream where you are at a theme park and there is a split second where your brain is in between where you were and where it thinks you are. He felt like he was on the beach with Ellory. The wind blowing and Bailey panting as the three of them watched the sun set. Michael was a few moments ago reveling in this very fine moment when a total stranger surprised him in the cafeteria by covering his eyes and planting a kiss on him the moment he hurriedly turned around. She tasted a little like a Maddie, but he knew he had better stick to pronouns to be safe.

"Whatya wanna do today?" She said in a bubbly tone. Why can't someone come say hello so and so, funny seeing you here.

"Well, what would you like to do?" Michael arrived at the end of that basic sentence feeling proud of how he navigated.

"I asked you first, but, I was thinking maybe you would wanna back to where we were last night and ya know hang out there for a bit?" She bit her lower lip and grinned. At this moment Michael was both confused and clandestinely excited by whatever the hell he did last night. Why did I pick this person, I know why she picked me. I am good looking and funny. But what did I see in her? She is pretty but this lunch has been dull. Perhaps my fault, she sounds engaging and playful. Also what the hell in my past did I change to get here? Oh my goodness what if we have been together for a long time. Don't panic but look at her hand, any rings? phew ok. So much to think about, I want to tell Ellory about this she would think it is a riot. But I can't right now. I am trapped moving through this series of events. Here for reasons I don't know. It feels like tension. Michael closed his eyes. I am here for a moment he thought. All this confusion is OK, after all I am sharing this moment with a stranger I could be in love with, that is not a new feeling.

"Ugh, you ok?" The girl asked.

Michael opened his eyes. "Yeah, I am. Sorry, you ready to go enjoy the evening?" Michael said smiling. Katherine with a "k" he thought, I am pretty sure that's it.

"Yeah, sure thing, let me put my tray away." The two walked over to the conveyor where she they set their plates.

"I am glad to be with you" Said Michael extending his hand. The two smiled.

"I am glad to be with you too" said Quasimodo.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok you lost me at Quasimodo.  Iâm thinking maybe it will make sense in the next chapter.  Like heâll have fallen into a seat at a movie theater or something.  At a later part in the date maybe?

I like that youâre getting into the impacts of the time travel on and in Michael.  As usual much to think about hidden in the piece.  Is Michael really bored with the girl or has Ellory just kind of turned all other girls into non-entities for him?  He canât wait to tell Ellory, etc. means she is forefront in his mind even when sheâs not there. 

It also speaks to a deeper point.  We know heâll be there when she dies.  That is a big moment in a personâs story.  But telling Ellory about the thing happening to him in this scene is like a small almost non existent thing.  But it shows that love and friendship live in the small moments, not the big ones.

It sounds like he is admitting he is in love with Ellory.  Interesting thought.  She is not the same person every time he goes back.  Normally (ie in non-time traveling couples :) ) you get to see people change very slowly.  The question is not which Ellory does he love but rather when is the Ellory he loves.  

I would play with the dissonance he is feeling a little more.  Like in his physical environment are there things he is eating or doing that catch him off guard?  Like does he find tea packets in his pocket because he switched from soda to tea or something like that?  And what is in the pockets of a man who time travels? 

Zeb is becoming a great off-stage character.  A good foil for jokes and also ideas.  I wonder if Zeb is the same no matter what comes or changes in the time stream.  Like a dancer moving across the stage regardless of whether itâs heaving or not.  I think itâs good to have something constant like that in a book about things constantly changing.  You can always count on Oleâ Zeb to be weird.  Etc.

Good piece.  For some reason Michael is starting to morph as a character.  Stand out a little clearer.  Someone it is the calmness with how he reacted to this situation and worked through it.  But he is definitely solidifying in my mind.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Some days</em>, Michelle thought, as the tray of food began to descend, <em>some days it all just goes right</em>.&nbsp; Thirty seconds before that it had all gone wrong...for Stinky Stacy MacMillan.
<p style="text-align: center">---------------------------</p>
Like everyone else in the Town with an unwanted moniker, Stinky Stacy had been given hers by Michelle.&nbsp; It was due to an unfortunate event during a school field trip to the town water factory two years back.

In the interest of safety the girls had been paired up and the boys had been paired up and assigned to a chaperone.&nbsp; It was a stupid practice Stacy had thought at the time, but according to her teacher experience had proven time and again that boys were stupid and required constant supervision while around heavy machinery.&nbsp; The boys, of course, complained but Ms. Miss and the factory safety supervisor were refused to hear any dissention.

At the gates the boys stared daggers and grumbled while they were divided up.&nbsp; Stacy would have preferred to choose her own partner but Ms. Miss was apparently trying to soften the blow for the boys.

"Michelle," Ms. Miss said, reading from her roll list.&nbsp; She scanned it, looked at the group of girls and scanned it again.&nbsp; Then scanned it two more times.&nbsp; "Hmmmm, hmmmm, oh Stacy!&nbsp; You and Michelle can be safety partners."

All eyes turned to Stacy.&nbsp; A few of the girls looked at her sadly, but most had looks of guilty and not-so-guilty relief.

"I can partner with Michelle," Sarah said sweetly.&nbsp; Stacy's heart leapt but sank again as Ms. Miss shot it down.

"Oh, that is sooooo sweet, Sarah," Ms. Miss said smiling broadly.&nbsp; "You are just so sweet.&nbsp; But Stacy is happy to do it this time."

"Do it?" Michelle said.&nbsp; She dropped her voice into a perfect imitation of Ms. Miss's whispy voice.&nbsp; "Why, Miriam, what scandalous talk."

Everyone paused to see how Ms. Miriam Miss would react.&nbsp; She ignored Michelle and turned back to Sarah.&nbsp; "It's fine, Sarah.&nbsp; Thank you for offering."&nbsp; She turned back to Stacy.&nbsp; "You and Michelle are safety buddies."

Michelle grabbed Stacy and pulled her over to where Sarah and her assigned partner, Beatrice, were standing.&nbsp; Sarah beamed benevolently and with practiced patience while <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span> went through a nonstop monologue covering everything from her breakfast to what dress she wanted to wear to church this Sunday.&nbsp; Every few sentences were punctuated with "What do you think, Sarah?"

Michelle pulled Stacy over right as Sarah was interjecting a "I don't know, <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span>, what do you think should be your favorite flower?"

"Can it, <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span>," Michelle said, edging between the two girls.&nbsp; <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span> immediately fell silent.&nbsp; She had yet to receive a "Michelle name" but only because she normally flew under the radar.&nbsp; But being around Sarah tended to pry a person's tongue loose.

"Can you believe that?" Michelle muttered.

"I am sure it was not a slight, Michelle," Sarah said.

"You can it, too, Goldilocks.&nbsp; Ms. Miss has hated me ever since she found out my mother said 'Ms. Miss will lay down for any guy on the off-chance he might be willing to get her out of that last stupid name'."

"How did she find that out?" <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span> said then put a hand over her rebel mouth.&nbsp; Luckily, Michelle had her laser beam boring into their teacher's back.&nbsp; Ms. Miss stopped partnering and turned her head to look at the four girls.&nbsp; Her eyes locked on Michelle and the two stared coldly at each other until eventually Michelle smiled and looked away.

"What?" Michelle said.

<span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span> looked at Stacy and Sarah uncertainly then after a nod from Sarah continued.&nbsp; "How did Ms. Miss find out your mom--"

"Because," Michelle said.&nbsp; "I told her 'My mom says you will l<span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">ay down for any guy on the off-chance he might be willing to get you out of that last stupid name'."</span>

Stacy's mouth dropped open.

"Michelle, that is a horrible thing to say," Sarah scolded.&nbsp; "Ms. Miss is so nice."

Michelle shrugged again.&nbsp; "I was just relaying a message.&nbsp; It was during a parent-teacher conference so it isn't like I did it behind anyone's back."&nbsp; She turned to Stacy.&nbsp; "You had better shut that before you get any flies in there."

Michelle's face had taken on that look it got when she was thinking through horrible names to give someone.&nbsp; It was like looking into the dead eyes of a shark while it flipped through a cookbook looking for just the right recipe to eat you with.&nbsp; Stacy's jaw slammed hard so hard that it clicked.

"Come on! The line is moving," Sarah said, breaking Michelle's concentration.

"What?" Michelle said.

"Line, silly," Sarah called.&nbsp; She was already tugging <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">Beatrice</span> forward.&nbsp; Kids and even a few chaperones parted to let them through.

Michelle rolled her eyes.&nbsp; "Come on, Stace," she said, grabbing Stacy's arm.&nbsp; "Let's see who can stay awake the longest."

<i>Did Michelle just call me "Stace"?</i> Stacy thought with a burgeoning sense of hope.&nbsp; Michelle called only one person by an abbreviated name (and even that was infrequent): Sarah or "Ra".

The rest of the way to the front of the line Stacy practically skipped.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Michelle is someone I both really like and really hate. She is a big presence and I am always excited to see how mean she can be. Ah the water factory, now that I read that and have thought about that would that be the right name for it? 
I like these kids, they feel scrappy. I wanna know how Stacy got Stinky Stacy, I feel bad for her and everyone who comes in contact with her. I like the intro being oh what a great day to a story titled the wrong day. I was looking for Sarah to be mean but she still seems nice all around. I love the dead eyes of a shark line. I am moving to part 2! Amazing dialogue as usual. Ps logan read this to me, she does great sass for Michelle. Lol]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The water tour was everything Stacy and the class had expected it to be: monotonous and filled with trips to the bathroom.&nbsp; Apparently, it was proper to indulge in whatever a factory produced while on tour.&nbsp; The students' $10 tour fee covered a lunch and bottled water, lots and lots of bottled water.

"And this, kids, is where we make the water," Elmer Duck (pronounced Duke) said waving an arm at a giant machine.&nbsp; Workers were turning various knobs and checking dials and pressure gages.

"Is it safe to be in here, Mr. Duck?" Stacy asked.&nbsp; The machine was deafening and looked a fairly long in the tooth.&nbsp; Rust colored much of the giant pipes feeding into and out of the machine.&nbsp; Elmer Duck (pronounced Duke) peered down at her.

"Safe?" he cackled.&nbsp; "You want to see the safe?&nbsp; There is nothing in there, girlie.&nbsp; Let me tell you."&nbsp; Ms. Miss leaned in and shouted something in Elmer's ear.&nbsp; A look of comprehension slowly, very slowly, appeared on his face.&nbsp; Stacy noticed that Ms. Miss's hand remained on Elmer's shoulder.&nbsp; She looked over to see Michelle smirking at her.&nbsp; Stacy smiled uncomfortably.&nbsp; Michelle's smirk was a cross between a lion getting ready to eat you and a lion who had eaten you.&nbsp; Or maybe it was just the blinking red light on Michelle's teeth that made--

Stacy looked closer at Michelle's mouth then up at the ceiling.&nbsp; There was a red light bulb flashing.&nbsp; There was a faded sign next to it that was peeling off the wall around its edges.&nbsp; <em>Caution</em>, it read and then something else illegible.&nbsp; She wracked her brain trying to remember what the safety briefing Elmer had given them said, but she could not recall anything about flashing red lights.&nbsp; Now that she thought about it the safety presentation had been a tour of the Wall of Ducks (pronounced Dukes) that showed every Duck over the last 100+ years who had been CEO of the water company.&nbsp; The entire safety presentation Elmer had given was about always watching where you stepped lest you break a leg like everyone one the Wall of Ducks (including Elmer Duck--pronounced Duke--who walked with a limp and a cane).

Stacy tried to point at the light and show Michelle but the other girl ignored her and turned her gaze back onto Ms. Miss.&nbsp; The light was flashing fast now.&nbsp; Stacy had to do something, tell someone who would do something.&nbsp; She began threading her way forward through the throng of students and chaperones.&nbsp; After a moment of pushing and sliding past people she made it to bottom of the rickety steps leading up to the platform in front of the machine.&nbsp; She could hear Elmer better up here.

"Mr. Duke," she said, waving her arms.&nbsp; He kept speaking for a few more seconds then turned and gave Ms. Miss a quizzical look.&nbsp; The teacher mouthed "What?" to Stacy and the pointed off to where the bathrooms were located.

Stacy shook her head and pointed up at the blinking red light.&nbsp; Most of the boys were punching each other in the arms outside of the view of the chaperones.&nbsp; The girls were clustered in groups most likely talking about nothing related to the giant machine in front of them or the water bottling factory.&nbsp; She pointed more urgently at the light.&nbsp; Mr. Elmer was now also mouthing "What?" and pointing towards the bathroom.&nbsp; Every few points he would stop and ask Ms. Miss something who shrugged.&nbsp; The light seemed to be blinking faster.&nbsp; Stacy began to panic.&nbsp; Then Sarah was there in front of her pointing up at the blinking red light.&nbsp; All eyes followed her finger to the ceiling.

And then pandemonium broke loose.

Kids scattered, knocking into each other.&nbsp; Chaperons grabbed kids and tried to drag them away. One or two just pushed kids out of their way and ran, maybe hoping that the kids would follow on their own,&nbsp; Stacy was not sure.&nbsp; Elmer yelled a high pitched screech which caused Ms. Miss to slam her hands over her ears.&nbsp; He stood paralyzed.&nbsp; Everyone else was running everywhere and suddenly Sarah was yanked back from the foot of the platform.&nbsp; Stacy looked back in time to see Michelle half pulling, half shoving Sarah towards one of the doorways, Beatrice trailing in their wake.

The scene was chaos because everyone was moving at once trying to get towards the single exit.&nbsp; The emergency exit door was blocked by several pallets of bottled water.&nbsp; Stacy frantically looked around until unbelievably her gaze fell on a large switch with <em>Emergency Shut Off</em> printed in large faded letters below it.&nbsp; There were other words written below those but the peeling paper made them hard to see.

Before she realized what she was doing, Stacy ran up the steps, shoved Elmer out of the way and grabbed the switch that he had been casually wresting his elbow on only minutes ago.&nbsp; She pulled with all of her strength.&nbsp; It did not budge.&nbsp; Stacy pulled again and looked up at Elmer, trying to get his attention.&nbsp; He looked down at her but stayed frozen in place.&nbsp; Frustrated she began yanking on the switch until finally she placed one foot against the side of the machine and heaved with all of her might.

The switch flipped down and Stacy went flying.&nbsp; The machine suddenly feel completely silent.&nbsp; People stopped, taken off guard by the silence.&nbsp; A low rumble started.&nbsp; It seems to travel up the machine and then as it made its way towards the pipe turned into a gurgling sound.&nbsp; Stacy, along with everyone else, followed the sound with her eyes.&nbsp; Suddenly, a flap in the pipe above Stacy's head opened up.&nbsp; Stacy had enough time to think <em>I am going to die.&nbsp; It's steam!</em> before giant stream of water came gushing out of the flap and slammed into her.

The force of it knocked Stacy down the steps of the platform and back ten feet.&nbsp; She rolled another two or three feet coming to a stop in front of a crowd of students and chaperones.&nbsp; Stacy was drenched and dazed.&nbsp; She shook her head a few times.

"What is that ungodly stench?" Sarah said.&nbsp; Stacy realized she had been throw halfway across the shop floor and landed directly at Michelle and Sarah's feet.&nbsp; Something shifted under Stacy: Beatrice.&nbsp; Stacy must have rolled into her and knocked her down.

"Get off me!" Beatrice yelled.

"What is that ungodly stench?" Sarah said again.

"It smells like" Michelle wrinkled her nose, "sewage."&nbsp; Sarah covered her dainty nose and took a few steps back.&nbsp; The next few seconds happened in slow motion.&nbsp; Stacy felt Beatrice shove her hard from below.&nbsp; Stacy looked down to see the Beatrice was staring horrified at Sarah's look of disgust.&nbsp; Then Stacy saw a small smirk creep over Michelle's face.&nbsp; A killer's smile devoid of any emotion.&nbsp; <em>No!</em> Stacy thought frantically.

"Look, it's Backwater Betty and Stinky Stacy," Michelle said.

Around her, kids, adults, even her teacher busted out laughing.&nbsp; She could see Elmer, now leaning on the switch for balance while he doubled over with laughter.&nbsp; Stacy looked down and recoiled.&nbsp; In Backwater Betty's eyes was a look of hatred so intense that Stacy knew she would never ever let herself get caught alone with her. &nbsp;<em>No,&nbsp;</em>Stacy thought.&nbsp;<em>Stinky Stacy.&nbsp; Stinky Stacy can never be alone with Backwater Betty again.&nbsp;</em>The look in Betty's eyes though indicated that maybe even having other people around would not be enough to keep her safe.
<p style="text-align: center">---------------------------</p>
Stacy had been in the lunch line, her classmates keeping the cruel six foot distance from her.&nbsp; She did not stink.&nbsp; Stinky Stacy washed herself more often and more vigorously, almost to the point of scrapping off skin.&nbsp; But it did not help.&nbsp; Shame smelled as bad as dirt and could not just be washed away with a little soap and water.&nbsp; Stacy told herself she did not notice how far everyone kept from her, even the adults.&nbsp; Paying for her lunch was maddening.&nbsp; She usually had to practically throw her money to the lunch lady behind the cash register.&nbsp; Otherwise the lunch lady would go on break with a 'leave it on the counter, dear' tossed back over her shoulder.

Stacy trudged out of the lunch line and into the cafeteria to look for a seat.&nbsp; The only good thing about being stinky was that you could have any seat you wanted.&nbsp; Entire tables would clear as soon as she sat down. Surrounding tables, too.&nbsp; But Stink Stacy did not like seeing people get up and leave their lunches on her account.&nbsp; She had done a lot of reading about health over the last two years, specially healthy foods, specially foods that did or did not cause a person to smell bad.&nbsp; She had sworn off garlic, though she did not care for that anyways.&nbsp; But a few of the other foods she missed.&nbsp; It was important to eat so she stayed along the walls with the other derelicts, six feet from the other derelicts.

"Stop woolgathering," someone said.&nbsp; She looked up just in time to see Backwater Betty, the usual look of hatred, in her path.

"I--" Stacy started

Then she tripped.&nbsp; Her shoe lace she realized belatedly, she had noticed it in line and meant to tie it.&nbsp; Stacy fell forward, hitting her elbow hard, which made her cry out.&nbsp; Somehow she ended up on her back.&nbsp; Her tray of food was in the air, just completing the arc up, and now beginning to descend fast, toward her face.&nbsp; The tray struck her on the forehead but it was plastic so it only stung a little.&nbsp; The silverware missed her thankfully, but the food, of course, was not as considerate.&nbsp; Mashed potatoes slammed into her hair, carrots landed on her chest and her bowl of soup came down upright, but then hit her chin and flipped over, coating her neck in lukewarm beef stew.

"Klutz!" Backwater Betty laughed.&nbsp; It was a harsh laugh with no humor in it.&nbsp; <em>Never alone with her</em>, Stacy thought automatically.&nbsp; Everyone in the cafeteria laughed also though Stacy thought she heard genuine humor in most of their voices.&nbsp; She sighed and rolled over to get up then stopped.&nbsp; Under her face was a pair converse.&nbsp; Stacy recognized those converse and the legs sprouting out of them.&nbsp; Michelle...

Stacy rolled back onto her back.&nbsp; Michelle stared down at her, that look in her eyes, like she was flipping through a rolodex of horrible nicknames looking for juuuust the right one for the situation.

<em>I hope it's not Stinky Carrot Stacy, </em>Stacy thought, realizing that one was now jabbing her in the back.&nbsp; <em>I like carrots</em>.

Backwater Betty stepped forward to stare down at her as well.&nbsp; She was looking down at Stacy and then over at Michelle with a gleeful look.

Michelle's lips parted and Stacy waited for her sentencing for her klutziness.
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">---------------------------</span></p>
It was almost too easy.&nbsp; So easy that maybe she should have passed it up.&nbsp; Stinky Stacy covered in carrots and soup, sprawled on the floor.&nbsp; Stacy's best friend, Betty was there too.&nbsp; Or&nbsp; maybe they were bitter enemies.

The name came to Michelle in a flash.&nbsp; Some days were just perfect.&nbsp; It laid everything out for you so that all you had to do was--

Michelle paused.&nbsp; Her mouth was half open, the new name, a masterpiece of a name, on the tip of her tongue.&nbsp; She paused, noting that the cafeteria had grown silent.&nbsp; The pause would only make it more dramatic.&nbsp; Give this masterpiece the dramatic entrance into the world that it deserved.&nbsp; She started again--

Michelle looked at Stacy, really looked at her.&nbsp; The girl, covered in whatever the lunch ladies were trying to pass off as stew today, vegetables scattered all around her.&nbsp; She sat patiently, waiting for Michelle to drop the hammer.

<em>What is wrong with me,</em> Michelle thought.&nbsp; She meant <em>What is taking me so long?</em> but it morphed into something else.&nbsp; Something that had been gnawing at the back of her mind recently.&nbsp; <em>What have I become?&nbsp;</em>she thought.

Michelle bit her lower lip, forcing, literally forcing the words she had loaded, loacked and ready to fire back into her throat.&nbsp; It felt like swallowing bile.&nbsp; The sensation gave her added strength.&nbsp; Everyone was watching her, waiting. &nbsp;<em>Center stage is Ra's game, not mine.</em>&nbsp; The name almost came tumbling out, but she bit it back.&nbsp; It was like a coiled snake, trying to blast through her teeth and get out.

Michelle extended a hand to Stacy.&nbsp; "Come on, Stace.&nbsp; Let's get you cleaned up."&nbsp; Stacy looked up at her.&nbsp; She looked at Michelle's outstretched hand, then at Michelle's mouth.&nbsp; She didn't take her Michelle's hand.&nbsp; Instead a wary look came over her features.&nbsp; Michelle pushed her hand closer.

"Come on, Stace.&nbsp; Let's go."

Slowly, tentatively, Stacy reached up and took Michelle's hand.&nbsp; She gripped it lightly at first then stronger once she saw that Michelle wasn't going to snatch it back.&nbsp; Stacy watched Michelle's eyes carefully as Michelle pulled her up.&nbsp; She was waiting for Michelle to suddenly release her grip and drop Stacy flat on her butt.&nbsp; For some reason, that was like a punch into Michelle's heart.&nbsp; Once Stacy was standing, Michelle turned towards the bathrooms.&nbsp; She grabbed her book bag.

"That's it?!!" Backwater Betty screeched.&nbsp; "That's it?!"

Michelle spun on her heel.&nbsp; "Shut up, Bac--"&nbsp; She stopped.&nbsp; "Shut up, Beatrice."&nbsp; Beatrice reeled backwards like Michelle had struck her, then slowly collapsed onto her knees.&nbsp; She sighed heavily.&nbsp; "Beatrice," she said.&nbsp; A small tear rolled down her cheek.

Another pain hit Michelle like a punch to the heart.&nbsp; She vaguely recognized the feeling: guilt.&nbsp; It felt weird, though oddly familiar.&nbsp; Like riding a bike after you had been off one for a while.

Michelle grabbed Stacey's wrist and pulled her a few steps forward.&nbsp; Stacy allowed herself to be led for a few feet then Michelle felt Stacy begin walking with more purpose.

"Beatrice?" one of the boys asked as she and Stacy walked by.

Michelle whirled on him.&nbsp; "You got a problem with that, tit rat?"&nbsp; The boy shuttered and stepped back, raising his hands in supplication.&nbsp; For some reason that pissed Michelle off even more.&nbsp; She stormed out of the cafeteria towards the bathrooms, Stacey following then after a few more feet, walking beside Michelle.

<em>What the Hell?</em> Michelle thought again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is a peculiar thing for a man to live in a salt shaker. Normally persons prefer to live in far larger structures with roofs without little holes in them. Even though he didn't choose to live there he made the best of it, piling salt into a a circular igloo like shape similar to ones he had seen in national geographic. The roof of the salt circle was impossible to get just right but it didn't ever rain in the storage cabinet and usually Bethany remembered to turn off the lights when she locked up.

She was sweet and air headed always giggling. Whenever Johny came in to order coffee and smoke, Bethany frequently came skipping into the store room. She would put her knuckle in her mouth and squeal then turn heal with some napkins or straws to carry back and forth. Griffin would lean to the edge of the salt shaker and shake his head, "That silly girl" He thought. He liked watching her skip around. Mrs. Josie made a habit of swinging the door open to shake her head at Bethany as she danced around in the store room. She would hand her a broom and click her teeth. This small drama unfolded with only a man in a salt shaker to appreciate it. Josie protected Bethany, she was once carefree and prone to falling for one young man after another.

Josie's son often came to the storeroom with his skinny friend to play board games or cards. Griffin tried yelling "Don't move there!" But Rodney couldn't hear and moved his piece setting up a triple jump. The Skinny friend smiled. Neither of them could hear him and he was too small to rock his container from one place to another. It was frustrating watching Rodney playing the same game every time. Griffin found himself shaking his head, "that boy" he thought.

Griffin's home was behind a row of other shakers and the Josie's Diner had a terrible restocking policy where new shakers were added to the front row. It didn't really bother Griffin at first but after months of being in the same spot it occupied more and more of his mind. "What a silly system! Why doesn't anyone properly stock. It is not that hard a concept." The chances of going to a table meant he could potentially be noticed and maybe someone would eventually unscrew the lid and release him from his home.

Late at night his capture would come check in and clink on the glass shaker waking Griffin. A grinning face gazed a few moments to be completely sure Josie's hadn't corrected their terrible stocking methods and freed Griffin. Sometimes Griffin rolled out of his crystalline igloo to chat. Greenville was his capture but it was nice to chat with someone. Mostly they talked about the weather and Cousin gossip.

"Looks sunny from in hear" Griffin said warmly to dark room after feeling a thud on the shaker.

"It's not, overcast for over a week" A grumbly voice answered.

"Well it was quite nice in here" Griffin said plopping down on a salt bench.

"I quite like you in there too" The voice said then thumped the glass again before turning to leave.

"Have a good night" Griffin said rolling back over to go back to sleep.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice!!  Very nice intro to one of the major(ish?) characters.  Clean efficient writing.  Characterization of Griffin is solid and you get double mileage by having us learn about Griffin through developing other characters in the town and also laying out some plot threads.  

Excellent work dude.  Nothing I would change.  But you did bring up a really good questionâthe weather.  I wonder how does everything going on affect the weather?  Is Minty Noseâs town static weather?  Always the same within the same temperature range.  Are massive storms always coming out of the small territory they belongs to Griffin since heâs not there.  Is the weather around the diner always sunny?  

Are Griffinâs bureaucrats looking for him or is the world designed to not need a demigod to exist/oversee the town?  Lots of good questions generated from this piece.  Again very strong work.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rose flexed her fingers and groaned inwardly.Â  They had long since become callused and strong from her time stripping the stems and other non-essential material from the tobacco used to make the cigars.Â  Still the work was hard and no amount of time spent at the stripping tables seemed to make it any easier.

The other women along the line were mostly Cuban, though there was a smattering of others like her friend Neva who was American like her.Â  A few Puerto Ricans had staked a claim at one of the far endsâprime real estate at a table where the women sat packed in like sardines, shoulder to shoulder.Â  The Puerto Ricans took turns swapping out the end-of-the-bench spot, a brief respite from the press of bodies.

The men had more room at their tables where they rolled the cigars.Â  That apparently was more of an art than stripping and therefore needed a luxurious, full inch of space between each man.Â  It seemed odd to Rose that the men had the extra space when their arm movements were forward and back mostly.Â  The women spent a lot of time making lateral movements as they pulled and tugged at stems creating a dance of politeness, irritation and usually bruising up and down the line.

That is how Roseâs brain worked though, always dissecting everything looking for a better way to do it.Â  For example, the womenâs table was all the way at the front while the tobacco was all the way at the back of the cigar rolling factory.Â  The women had to waste precious working time walking down row after row of tables of the cigar rollers.Â  That was inefficient when you were paid by the ounce of quality tobacco you made.

When she said as much to Neva the other woman had laughed with that deep baritone, throaty laugh she had.Â  A laugh that felt warm and strong and for some strange reason Rose couldnât put her finger on, slightly rebellious.

âWeâre in the front so the men can look at our asses when we stand up.Â  The rest get to see our full, luscious breast bouncing as we walk.Â  Didnât you ever wonder why the top producing rollers get the front and back rows?âÂ  Neva laughed again.Â  âAss-men in the front, breast-men in the back.â

âWho gets the middle?â Rose had asked.

Neva had only winked and gone back to her work.Â  It took her a moment but then Rose had blushed furiously as she understood the joke.Â  Up and down the table the other women had laughed good naturedly at her.Â  A few making remarks Rose would have been heavily disciplined for inâ¦Â  But the past was better left to die alone behind you.Â  That was another of Nevaâs sayings.

Though she was only two years older Neva seemed ancient with knowledge, her eyes weary but defiant. Â <em>I wish I could be unbreakable like her, </em>Rose had thought on more than one occasion.

The other end of the table was always reserved for an older Jamaican woman.Â  Her skin was so dark that it seemed to gleam.Â  Rose had wondered how the woman could hold such a choice spot until she saw Neva defending it three or four times out behind the factory on a smoke break.Â  Neva was fierce.Â  Once she had won a fight without throwing a single punch.Â  She just stood in front of her opponent, a much larger woman, taking her blows and kicks, never flinching, a look of quiet cold rage growing in her eyes.Â  When Neva had eventually raised a single fist the other woman had backed away immediately, hands up in supplication, her confidence broken.Â  The other woman had been much larger than Neva but something in the fiery, young womanâs posture spoke of well of bottle rage waiting to come forth.Â  That woman had been new.

Two weeks later, passing down the line of tables Neva had stopped in front of the woman, blocking her path.Â  The room had grown silent.Â  Neva raised her fists slowly, giving the other woman time to strike first.Â  It had been a quick, but brutal fight.Â  Neva at one point sitting on top of the crying woman, smashing her fists over and over again into her half covered face.Â  Neva had not been looking down, she had stared out across the room, making eye contact with each man, hatred burning.Â  When Neva stood up she stared into the face of each man, challenging them silently as she wiped the blood from her hands onto her apron.

Most of the men looked away, some stared back with unconcealed hatred, but a few, a very few smirked a challenge back at her.Â  Those were the ones she danced with at night in the cafes and bars when the women collectively went out with the men for an after work drink.Â  A few had come in over time with a black eye or a scratched up face, but they had never seemed upset at their injuries.Â  Rose wondered what had made Neva into the wild thing of beauty, laughter, and fury that she was.

Everyone came with secrets and Rose had recently gotten one of her own: inside her a tiny life was growing now.Â  It had come on suddenly, the sickness in the morning and sometimes after lunch.Â  The continuously near-ravenous hunger was almost maddening.Â  She had not told Abelardo but soon the women of the table would figure it out and it would pass quickly to the men.Â  In a factory gossip traveled like wild fire.Â  If she was going to be the first to tell him she would need to do it soon.Â  But there was somethingâ¦somethingâ¦she could not describe it, but there was something to being the only one that knew about the child inside her womb.Â  Something to being the only one that knew his (yes, she knew it was a he) that knew his name.Â  It was comforting and terrifying andâ¦all hers.Â  Only hers.

The nausea hit her suddenly then and she hunched forward.Â  The other women noticed.Â  A few of the older onesâ gazes lingered.Â  <em>I need to tell him very, very soon</em>, Rose thought.Â  She wondered how she would sit at the table once her stomach was protruding so large that her arms would not reach.Â  Again, an inefficiency.Â  The rollersâ benches moved and so could be pushed back, the strippers bench was bolted to the floor.Â  No one knew why.

Neva looked down at her timepiece she kept in her pocket.Â  She cursed colorfully.

âThat bastard moved the time back again.Â  Five full minutes.Â  He is getting bold,â she said.Â  Sometime the foreman would adjust the clock back to get a few more minutes work out of everyone.Â  It seemedâagainâinefficient since rollers were paid by the pound and strippers by the ounce, not based on any length of time spent working.Â  But like the bolted bench it made no sense and no one who noticed ever said anything to the foreman.Â  Not even Neva.

<em>Today at lunch, </em>Rose thought.Â  <i>Orâ¦maybe tonight at the bar.Â  But I will tell Abelardo today.Â  Be unbreakable.Â  Today or tomorrow at the latest!</i>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can feel the Cuban sun in this world, clay houses and colorful old cars. This feels like a world Hemingway would inhabit! Oh I hope he is around somewhere. Ok, so Neva and Doyle need to meet, they sound like they get one another. Probably not stay together because of some inevitable fight both would take to far but both would carry sweet memories of the other to their graves neither ever apologizing. :) . Your characters and their dialogue though brief speak to complex three dimensional characters in a full and exciting world. I am always amazed at how you can accomplish so much with so little writing. I feel like I could have Beer with Neva.
So I have no idea where this is going but so far we have a combative world of labor workers in a gossipy high context culture. There is so much here that is intriguing. So many questions: Who's the Dad? IS she cheating on someone? Why is she afraid to say she is pregnant? Why is Neva guarding that older woman's spot? I am prepared to know this person and go with her on battle of being and becoming. What will we learn together?

I feel like I know a lot about your writing now, but I am always amazed how every time I forget I am reading and end up spending some time in a different world. This is a great example, "A few of the older onesâ gazes lingered.  I need to tell him very, very soon, Rose thought." This is laden back story. Starting off a story with so many hooks, a great strong character and sense of impending change. It is intuitive like picking packages of emotion to attach to characters. I love the analytical stuff too, the woman are there so the men can see there asses. The foreman moves the clock even though they aren't hourly. Benches are bolted to the floor too close to a overcrowded table. It makes the protagonist stand out as being perceiving and tells about how they are already striving to surpass their environment. I look forward to reading more about strippers!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The cafÃ© was well lit and it hurt Rose's eyes coming from the dim lighting in the bar next door.&nbsp; Abelardo went to get some of the strong coffees he and the other rollers favored.&nbsp; "Liquid life" he called it because it gave a man new reserves of energy.&nbsp; It had become a joke between the strippers and rollers: "If you take him home get some 'liquid life' on the way, he's almost done".

For the most part, the women never took home or went home with the men.&nbsp; Neva sometimes did but not often.&nbsp; Instead the men and women danced slow and sensual in the near dark of the bars.&nbsp; Dances they had brought from their homelands. The first time Rose had danced with a man it felt almost predatory with her as the prey.  They traveled the floor, weaving through other couples, his eyes stared into hers as he led her body with his. When the dance was over he moved on and she went to sit down since her legs strangely were weak. The older women snickered and made little bawdy jokes. Rose left early, the strange flush staying with her all the way back to the flat she shared with four other women from the factory.

Rose loved the dancing.  It was a way to get close to Abelardo, to touch her face to his, feel his rough, tobacco-stained hands on the small of her back.&nbsp; He smelled of the factory. Everyone smelled of the factory, but on him it was exhilarating.

"You have a dance for Zacharias now?" asked a man's voice to her left.

Rose looked up. Zacharias moved like a cat to stand beside her. He was lithe but his forearms were muscled. A strong chin.

She gave him a small forced smile. "No more dancing for me tonight." Zacharias was a terrible flirt. He danced with all of the older women.

"We dance," he protested, smiling wryly.

Rose frowned.  The upcoming conversation with Abelardo was gnawing at her insides.  This was not helping.

"Your other dance partners are in there." She nodded her head towards to club next door.

He smiled. "What? Those old women? Never again. Only the spring chickens from now on. If I go home with them we play cards all night."

"Hopefully you play better than you dance," Rose said.  She had meant it to me cruel.

"You wound me," he said.  He placed a hand over his heart.  "I try the old hens again." Rose watched his glide away.

It still stung that he found every woman more attractive than herself. When everyone went to the bar he danced with every woman except Neva and Rose. Even the old Jamaican woman!

Rose had mentioned it once to Neva as they were walking home after a double shift.

"Do you think I am ugly, Neva?" Rose had asked.

"You aren't my type if that's what you're asking after," Neva had quipped back immediately, smirking. Rose envied her her quick wit.

Rose had, of course, blushed, she always blushed, and could not speak for a moment before finally being able to get back to Zacharias.

"I mean to say why does Zacharias dance with everyone but me and you?"

Neva had laughed out loud. "Do you want him to dance with you?"

"No, but I want him to want to dance with me," Rose said. Around them the street flowed with people and noise. Ybor City was a boom town and it brought people from all over the Caribbean and southern United States to Tampa to work or sell things to those workers. Sometimes random snippets of other people's conversation would drift through hers and Neva's.

"Maybe he doesn't like Southern Belles," Neva had said and did a short curtesy. A man in a sweat-drenched suit dodged around Neva and cursed at them both.

"I am not a Southern Belle!" Rose had said. "Why would he dance with everyone but us?"

The next time everyone had gone out Neva had danced with Zacharias. She had practically stalked him around the floor, slammed him into her then danced out of his reach with fierce, graceful spins. The older women had loved it and catcalled the dancers from the sidelines. The other men, too, had had fun, offering up good natured jibes whenever Neva out maneuvered him and left him standing alone while she twirled away, her eyes flashing mischievously as she looked back at him.

"Must just be you he finds ugly," Neva had said when she came back to the table. The crestfallen look Rose tried to hide sent the table of women into hysterics. One or two had actually rolled off their chairs and onto the floor.

The old Jamaican woman had cradled Rose's face and said "I wish he find me as ugly as you!"

None of it had been funny in Rose's opinion. The rest of the night the older women had tortured Zacharias, dancing with him and then dragging him back to the women's tables over and over again to force him to pick another dance partner. And the women had been merciless in their dancing, stalking him like Neva had done though few with her same grace and style.

Zacharias had avoided eye contact with Rose the entire night. Even when the women had tried (once literally) to push him at her he had blushed, stammered, and grabbed a different dance partner than Rose.

At the end of the night he had tried to pull her aside, presumably to apologize for being so cruel. Rose knew she was not pretty but for him not even to try to save her pride and dance with her once. It was unbearable. She had dodged past him and flown out the door, not even waiting for the other women to catch up and walk home with her.

The next day his bravado was back. He did not dance with any one the next time everyone went out. Or the time after that. But like a dog he eventually crept back into the circle of women, dancing with them, and of course, ignoring Rose.

"Can you believe he is back at it again, Neva?" Rose said a few days after.&nbsp; "What is he even doing?&nbsp; Can he actually like ALL of them?"

Neva had looked at her strangely then laughed and said, <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2c3338; cursor: text; font-family: 'Noto Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.2em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px">"One of the great mysteries of this modern era, Juliette." &nbsp;</span>

Abelardo returned with two coffees, breaking Rose out of her reverie.&nbsp; He watched Zacharias walking off.

"What did he want?" Abelardo asked, placing the coffees down on the table.

"Nothing," Rose said.&nbsp; She stood and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.&nbsp; As usual he looked around self consciously to see who was in the cafÃ©. &nbsp;<em>Men and their pride</em>, she thought with a sigh.

"So," he said, sitting across from her.&nbsp; "What was so important to pull us from the dancing?"

Rose stared at him, her mind working.&nbsp; She had rehearsed the speech a number of different ways, trying out different tones.&nbsp; He would be shocked yet happy, overjoyed.&nbsp; But now sitting in front of him, his black hair plastered against his skull after the hours of dancing, fear took ahold of her.&nbsp; She looked down at her coffee.&nbsp; Then to buy more time she picked it up and took a sip.&nbsp; Words ranged around her mind, to and fro, never where she could catch them.&nbsp; Finally, feeling that the silence growing uncomfortable.

She opened her mouth.&nbsp; "I..." Rose put her cup down hard on the saucer, her hand still holding the small handle.&nbsp; "I...I hate coffee," she said and leapt to her feet.&nbsp; Abelardo instinctively tried to rise since she was a lady and she was standing but he banged his thighs on the edge of the table.&nbsp; He grimaced and sat down hard.&nbsp; Rose heard him call out her name at the same moment she realized she was outside the cafÃ©, running down the street.&nbsp; She was two blocks away before she realized she was still holding the coffee cup.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["What is this class?"

A long pause was held interrupted my small coughs and squeaking chairs settling. A hand rose and Eddie nodded to proceed.

"English 561, the philosophy of great writers?" A thin girl with thick rimmed glasses said.

"A practical answer, much appreciated. I have spent as much as a few minutes waiting for an answer. It is an answer, but I like to think that there are a few more questions like that in this class. Lingering curious questions that don't have a clear origin. That was rhetorical after all, this old man hasn't yet lost his mind, so why did he ask that question. I see some of you writing this down, don't. This is just the intro and I want your attention on the ideas and notions not the specifics. If I had to boil down some trait that great writers had, one of them would be that they don't answer question using convention. They are also often unburdened with being tied with how the question <em>should</em> be answered. There are many question that the mind struggles with, some of you may know writers, particularly poets have a suicide rate five times higher than the average person. I think that speaks to something else many writers have, problems. Some of you laughed at that, which is interesting. Problems that the writers experience are often problems most people experience? do you agree? Are they different in their scope? Maybe there exists a natural filter whereby people prefer reading things that people with tragic pasts have written and so it is only the writers that get popular have advanced problems. Personally I think the filter works like this, writing attracts people who feel things intensely, wonder wildly and they want to somehow share all that they feel and experience. The mechanism of language is imperfect and thus we rely on inference from the readers calling upon common experiences we can stack like legos to build something bigger. My Daughter died of a drug overdose."

Silence filled the room and the students held their breath starring at the professor who again rocked back and forth on his heels.

"It was not good. I did not like that. It made me sad. Of course I could say those things with more color. But nothing would reliably share my experience. To be honest the pain is not something I am eager to share. It sometimes washes over me so completely I have to lay down. There are many great lessons we will learn and I mean not to prioritize them for you. But I am going to start with one I think is good. A quote from the playÂ <em>our Town</em>, 'Does anyone even realize life while they live it?' And the omnipotent narrator answers. 'No' pause 'The saints and the poets, they do some'. What does this mean? Well plainly we aren't good at appreciating life and breathing in all the meaning around us. So what is the lesson? I believe it is an economics lesson. What are you spending? Your very existence. How are you spending it? Have you even thought about how you are spending it and why? That is one of those big life questions and I think it is a type of question that doesn't have a clear origin and could be potentially sated with thoughtless truisms. Truthfully I don't think most people think about it once in a year. Those that do likely turn to someone else for some semblance of how they should answer. I can't tell you how to answer, and I don't think I should try. Let's wrestle with these uncomfortable questions and open our selves up to all that goes on around us. I think it will be a productive exercise and I look forward to getting started. That is all for today. Take the rest of the class time for yourself and spend it wisely.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow a lot to unpack here. Some pretty deep stuff. And also some pretty humorous stuff. Iâll be honest and itâs probably the same for you some of this hits really close to home :-).

I like the way the character has this cavalier attitude or most revealing deeply painful things. Maybe Cavalier is the wrong word.  Forced cavalierness?

But with deep stuff sometimes you need to break up with some humor. Youâre in a class full of people with lotta archetypes available.  Maybe you could play with that a little make it a double entendre. Do you have the girl who raises her hand every question, the know it all, that Hermione Granger. (By the way what does it say about our culture that half the words I audio speak or misspelled but Hermione Granger comes up perfectly and thatâs like nothing in the normal English language.)

But yeah so anyways I would use the convention or rather the turning convention on its head do you kind of_the guys point and maybe even heâs trying to show the students that and change them.

Do you have the girl that always raises her hand, you can have the guy that sleeps through class, you can have the guy studying for a different classâa âmore importantâ hard sciences class.  You can have the âpoetâ Who looks like a poet walks like a poet talks like a poet, but never actually write some poetry. In effect just does it to get girls.

Let me think you can have the goth girl, the overly happy girl who is secretly sad inside. Itâs been a while since college and high school but theyâre all there. Also the stoner kid. Which would have some sort of contrast or uncomfortable piece with the daughters overdose announcement. But I think you should leave those in Partly to break up the monologue style and partly because like I said they had humor but also they can add a layer of complexity. The stoner kid represents either his daughter at the beginning of her fall into drugs, or perhaps deep into the drugs.

Maybe he stands in front of that kidWhen he announces the overdose.  a girl in some ways represents Maybe not convention but archetype?  The pseudo-poet definitely lines to the poet speech I think.  Or in this might be much more complicated but I think it would be very rewardingâ¦â¦ You donât even lean on convincing. Instead of him standing in front of the drug kid to do the drug speech.  The drug kid is the easy target but maybe the girl who always raises her hand is obviously on speed trying to study or over study and be everything.  Actually I do think thatâs it in the first section tossing or sprinkle in those little tidbits about the characters. The goth girl is drawing skulls, the ovrrzealously smart girl is raising her hand continuously, the drug kid is doing whatever drug kids do the poet is emoting For the sake of being seen emoting.  And then he is furtively Checking to see whoâs watching.  

Maybe he calls on the smart girl the one time she doesnât raise her hand. Maybe she have to raise her hand and then stopped midway in the posit down and thatâs when he gets her.  

But like I said a lot of really good stuff in here. Itâs funny how this locked down makes you reflect sometimes on things you wouldnât normally. Those questions that came up late at night or over coffeeWhen you were in college and it seems like the only thing it was to do was dissect and analyze the world.  Looking back on those days I think more and more about the people that chose to make that a permanent situation. 

Students are really traveling through to get to the next place. But it seems like you always have that core of people Who maybe were assistant professors or the eternal TA.  They usually lived near the campus relatively cheap housing, they had no possibility of ever getting tenure or even a full-time position, and they spent a lot of time or rather has been a lot of time building the sanctuary. You know what I mean the house with the extensive garden in the back where they would sit out and stare at the sunset drink a beer or a cup of coffee and think about the world.

At the time those people blended into the background except at the very end of college and later when I was getting my Masters but working for the university to get the free tuition. Then I paid a lot more attention to them. Itâs funny how you come full circle. Maybe even pity those people because you think itâs hidden away from the world and reality. But when you get older and you build a career in the family in the life and you find it all youâre trying to do is the same thing build a small sanctuary Of a life.

It reminds me of my friend Dan.  He killed himself about five years ago. He loved  film and wanted to be a filmmaker. Worked in New York and Orlando and LA for a while.   Some stuff happened not his own fault But what was his fault was how he reacted to it. Iâve been with his parents and lived there until he was 40. Never got started. Then at one point he went back to our old arts high school and begin to teach film to the high school students. Sometimes I think that was what pushed him over the edge. Seeing the promise and absolute surety of success in the faces of these kids and feeling like he had missed his opportunity.

A really wise person said to me once writers write, filmmakers make films, poets make poetry, woodworkers and welders make sculpture. For a small few people with their stuff, and for an even smaller few a lot of people read their stuff. But at the end of the day what makes them all those things is it because they do it.

And I think thatâs where Dan went wrong or off the path. He tied success to other people approving and paying for his work. Artists canât do that. We have to look at creating art as the victory even if nobody reads it or likes it or whatever. Even if they canât make a living off of it.  And really what is making a living from art?   Tailoring you art to someone elseâs desires and wants. Sometimes I think that thing that was so hatedâthe 9-5 job, the corporate life, I think those things actually insulate and protect art.  Art can be free to room, and splash, and fail, and explore, and grow when it doesnât have the master of the public, or the rent, or the car payment holding its reins.

I think also why Dan killed him self is that he felt like so much time was lost and that he would never live that life that came with film and Hollywood.  My sister works in Hollywood and film and what I learned from that is it Hollywood itâs just like any other industry. A lot of people working in the lower tiers to support a few people on top making a shitload of money and getting all the frame. Just a bunch of 9 to 5ers like Everyone else.  Maybe closer to what they consider their dream, but are they any closer to the person that works all day, spent time with your family, and then hacks away for a few hours every night when everyoneâs gone to sleep to make their art.

Also getting back to your peace the shared experience thing kind of ties back into my friend.  You canât live in a cave and write for people who live in the sunshine. You have no context, you have no idea of their struggles, even with stuff today if a man lives with his parents how does he know the terror of losing his job, the feeling of powerlessness when the entire economy is down, To look at his kids and see the fear in their eyes as I try to process what that means that daddy or mommy is unemployed.  

I think one thing youâll find is that kids become a mirror. Not onlyI do you see yourself in the past, you see yourself in the present by guessing what the future will be. Every little thing becomes a potential sign of good or bad things that will come to the future for them. Auguries and Psychics and horoscope makers are half assed amateurs when it comes to the level of projecting and scrutiny that a parent has for their own children.

So maybe my statement above is wrong itâs not that Dan made a mistake because he put himself in a situation where success was based off of how the world or other people saw him it said he didnât choose which people defined Success for him.  You can generally control whether kids look up to you by your actions. You can control how your spouse feels about you to some extent by how you treat them and the kind of man that you are or arenât. Sending something off to some random contest or place put you in a position where you have no power to affect things or very little at least.

So maybe thatâs the key if you donât get out and live your life you have no experiences to relate to people. If you donât get out and live your life you canât build that audience, that small yet that you can use to reflect back your level of success as a man, as a writer, as an artist, and so on.

I donât know what killed Dan.  I know he did it, but I donât know what created the situation where that seemed like the right answer.  But I do think if he couldâve ever seen that unlike most people who say they want to be in film he was actually making them, maybe not successful ones as far as the world was concerned but good ones, good art.  He looked at himself as a failure maybe.  Lost cause. Never realizing that if you just got in the 95 or some sort even if it wasnât a real 9 to 5, but something that showed he was supporting his art, if heâd carved out his life and still kept his art he wouldâve been more successful than 99.9% of the people that say they wish they could be Artists, because he would actually be doing it.

OK I know itâs long and goes off on a tangent that doesnât relate back to your story. So let me try and get back on track.

I think what I just did in some ways is similar to the character, the teacher.  Maybe thatâs why I think itâs so important that he interact with the students even if heâs trying to lead them somewhere you know if thereâs some level of comedic interaction with them coupled with seriousness and attempt to teach them something. But people rarely ever learn listening to someone else.  They learn through dialogue with that person, back-and-forth.  They learn because as they speak theyâre trying to select an experience the plug them into conversation, an example at Taylorâs something in their life into the conversation that they can use then to evaluate where they stand based on that experience.

I think it was so dangerous to about our current situation in this country. So many people talking filling the airways but no one having a dialogue. Thereâs no back-and-forth exchange ideas, all the people talking and pushing an agenda.  It forces other people to lock down, to protect their own beliefs from what they feel is an attack. Thereâs no silence for the other person to speak and try and relate. Maybe everyoneâs too scared that in the silence the person will take over the monologue And not give up.  And then the longer they speak the more people except that as reality. But the truth is people always default back to what they believe in spite of everything the contrary. You have to change the entire way of interacting, we canât make people archetypes or âthemâ.  We have to give up the space for them to speak with the understanding and the agreement that they will give it back up to let us speak and consider our words as we consider theirs.

Learning and dialogue is not a popular thing.  It takes trust it takes time and itâs not quick and the actions may not always result in what you want to happen.  It can be easier to think Iâm going to take control of the situation, action is sexy, debate and thought unfortunately is not. But you canât build a sustainable long lasting society off of sexy anymore than a relationship can live off of the thrill of a game to people play when they first get together weâre starting to get together. Itâs hard once the chemistry of your body stop being the crutch to help you look past the things about your partner or spouse that annoy the shit out of you.

I think of my character Neva in the other story.  The real one that my characters based off. She had a really tough fucking life. A lot of people did in those days. They were times even now we canât imagine, even under this locked down and the economy stalling we can even imagine.  Kids sent to distant relatives because their own family couldnât feed them. Jobs scarce.  Families always on the move looking for any bit of work to keep them fed.  I know some of that exist today but not on the scale it was nationally and globally in Nevaâs day.

Still Iâm not sure if youâve ever listen to Kyle Carpenterâs interview on Jockoâs podcast.  He is a medal of honor winner who jumped on a grenade to save his friends when he was a Marine in Afghanistan. And he lived. He was pretty fucked up in a series of events happened where he shouldâve died but in every case some mistake, miracle, coincidence, just happen to be the right thing to happen it kept him alive a little longer. And then his road back itâs tough. I think his jaw has been blown off and a lot of other things had happened. Even his journey to become a medal of honor winner has some really interesting stuff in it and you can see why typically they pick dead soldiers and sailors and Marines.  The pressure and scrutiny is amazing. The dead medal of honor winner canât be interviewed, they canât Make the mistakes that people do, they canât tarnish the medal and the legacy and honor Of the past recipients by falling down.

But what Carpenter says is that is that struggle that connects all people. Everyone has problems. Sometimes your actions donât seem as important is jumping on the grenade to save your friends. But Wood Carpenter says is everybody jump on a grenade in their life.  And the people that jump on grenades once wonât necessarily do it again in the right moment but it needs to be done.

Heâs a great kid and itâs a great interview and the book is amazing too. It doesnât really relate to any of the stuff that weâre writing directly but I think it relates to everything Iâve written above.

Well that is a lot of thoughts droning on on a Sunday LOL]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Calowyn surveyed the dark room trying to make out an empty chair through the sea of heads in front of her.Â  After a few seconds of searching she gave up and looked for an empty spot along the wall that would leave an acceptable amount of space between her the listeners to either side of her.Â  She moved to a spot between a large man, maybe a Cascaian (it was hard to tell in the dark) and what appeared to be a female Nova.Â  The woman stepped minutely away from Calowyn, but the large man actually moved an inch or two into her space.Â  She ignored him and nodded politely to the woman for the courtesy.Â  When the woman returned her nod politely, Calowyn discarded the Nova theory.Â  "Polite" and "Nova" were words seldom used in the same sentence.Â  She nodded back and turned her attention to the speaker at the lectern.

"--do not know for certain," he was saying.Â  "But we believe, the manuscripts are legitimate based on this."Â  The man had a subtle theatricality to his movements Calowyn noticed.Â  He gestured and behind him the hologram of a manuscript appeared.Â  The hologram expanded until a small stain was prominently displayed.Â  "This watermark," he continued, "previously unnoticed until--well, until I spilled my coffee on the manuscript, revealing it."Â  A smattering of people laughed politely around the hall.

"There is some truth to that actually."Â  The man took a sip of water from a cup on the lectern. "My colleagues and I used the wrong reagent."Â  He gestured sheepishly.Â  More polite laughter from the audience.Â  The man next to Calowyn shook his head slightly, but she could not tell if it was in humor or from disgust.Â  "We spent the better part of a week analyzing the potential damage and preparing a report explaining our error and subsequent plans to rectify it.Â  It was not until we began the analysis on this relatively unimportant section of the manuscript that we found this."

The hologram shifted slightly and the stain swirled until it resolved itself into a circular pattern.Â  It was incomplete but there was no mistaking that it was a partial finger print.Â  Calowyn, like a few others in the crowd, raised her phone and snapped a quick picture of it.Â  The original would be virtually available after the lecture but old habits died slowly and having information and being able to verify it independently was a part of Calowyn's core training.

The man beside her grunted. "I will believe it when I see it."

Calowyn nodded politely without taking her eyes from the speaker at the lectern.Â  "How?

The man looked over.Â  "What?"

"How will you?" Calowyn said.

"How will I what?Â  How will I see it?Â  Why--" Â  Around them people shushed the man, a few with less than cordial hand gestures.Â  No one lifted their mask but the implication was there.

Calowyn ignored the man and stepped away from the wall.Â  She headed towards the nearest side aisle that led down to the stage.Â  Behind her, the man on the wall was arguing with someone.Â  A few voices were raising.Â  The noise had not reached the front of the auditorium yet but was getting louder.

"Sir," she said as she approached an usher standing near a door.Â  "That man back there along the wall.Â  The one arguing.Â  He is about to start a fight."

The usher spoke quickly into a walkie-talkie and moved off towards the commotion.Â  Calowyn watched him go then unobtrusively opened the door he had been standing in front of and stepped through it into the backstage area.

Ask a blowhard a nonsense question, leave abruptly, and let the sparks fly.Â  God, it felt good to be in the field again.Â  As she quietly closed the door she immediately began cataloguing her surroundings.Â  No one was nearby.Â  She considered switching her mask from the casual one she had worn to her military issue one in case she ran into another usher, but discarded the idea.Â  She was not in her world any longer.Â  Academia and academics did not take kindly to intrusions by nosy, lowly government researchers no matter how many science chits they had stitched on their temples.Â  Like any subculture it was invitation only.

Calowyn saw a small receptacle a few feet away, probably a prop closet, and stepped into it.Â  Now to wait for the good doctor to pass by so she could make her introduction, off the books.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just outside of town is a small Inn. The sign read's 'No Vacancy' in bright red neon. Miss James works the counter and maintains the front garden which consists of two brick planters extending into the waves of cracked asphalt. Built in 1818 the Inn was just named <em>The Inn</em> because it was the only Inn for fifty miles and people back then lacked for creativity. On the east side of the lot, where it is unpaved and gravel, there are still two hitching posts. It is said, by some imaginative folk, that Andrew Jackson came to have an affair at the Inn and tied his horse to one of those hitching posts. The lesser known person who had once tied a horse to those posts caught a presidential bullet in a duel after threatening a damning expose. Some say that the Inn's location is technically Palletstown, but they are not listened to. All that about history happening in the front of this Inn may give the impression of some import, but it wasn't actually Jackson it was Millard Filmore and he just watched the duel.

This place is a milestone to some but not to do with regular history. Every few years, based on changing Sumerian lunar cycles, a group of Cousins come and stay at the Inn. They rent all six rooms and raise hell for two months or so. Miss James is out every morning sweeping broken glass and spraying down the odd firespot with her garden can. On occasion Miss James would wake up at night to a bright silver light. On such nights she would light a cigarette pour into her Chevy and drive two miles down the road with the moon so near she thought she might touch it. A few harsh words and empty threats between hacking coughs and then boys would shut it down and turn towards bed. She would crank up the Skinnard and ride towards home with the moon back hiding far away behind clouds. It was on a night such as this she unleashed a particularly foul mouthed tongue lashing.

"Shit she about hexed you Thrumble" A tall dark razor thin man chuckled.

"Hmph, water drinken coward, she stayed we woulda had words" A grumbly voice grumbled shaking the pebbles of the dimly lit lot.

"I am fairly certain not but a few people can even make out the meaning of your words"Â  Said a short leathery man with long dark hair.

Thrumble grumbled but it was too low a frequency to hear save a few confused elephants at the zoo a hundred miles away.

"Wanna try this, I made it with bumblejack and kaka beans. Take a drink and pass it."Â  The thin man said reaching into the back of his Olds Mobile retrieved a large glass flagon and poured some of the contents into the cups. The six drank a large gulp and handed the mug to the person across from them. "Dremamewa" the thin man said waving his hand over the outstretched tankards. Another gulp.

"You son of a bitch! You slept with Willomena!?" Said a portly monk looking man half upset half laughing. The long haired man sank into a wry smile.

"Oh we got one! Mine is floating above the trees on a summers night. Scared congregants down below." The long haired man reminisced pushing back his straight silky locks from his face.

"What'd you get Minty?" The long thin dark man said in an excited whisper.

"Mine is, what appears to be uh, field, or meadow, bunch of bottles and some cut wheat. Oh this is a sacrifice, ok, I see it. Ah! What!" Minty jumped and tumbled to the ground covering his face with his hands. He panted as he saw cursed metal objects pointing towards him. He slowly came too and saw the men laughing and rolling on the ground.

"Haha very funny, whatha hell was that Zee?" He said pulling himself off the ground.

"Fuckin priests, got it in their heads my bones could cure one of the plagues." Zee said between sharp inhales of laughter. "Y'know they read it in some damn book, and I come to find out it was a cousin who gave it to em."

"That's one hell of a memory Zee, why the hell did ya wanna share that?" Said Minty in a nasally whistle.

"Wanted to see what those stupid fucking priests saw, pretty funny if you ask me. I hope they thought so, was the last thing they saw this side of things." The thin man smiled sharply.

" Oh, gev it to meh , you like that , wanna add more? " A voice low and suddenly sultry voice said.

"Oh boy, what memory did you give him Oggear?" The monkish man asked watching Thrumble drool a bit while gripping the corner of Zee's Olds Mobile gyrating and licking.

"Summer of 1972, Miami, first year of Doc J. G. Evers commune. I swear I gave that man real powers just to keep the pleasure cruise running. Gave thrumble the whole year, he may be out her till James comes and sweeps him up!" Said Oggear with wide eyes cheerfully.

A few side glances and then Zee grabbed the cork and pulled it with his teeth. "To Dr. Evers" He said as he poured another round and everyone passed their mugs to Oggear to sip.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn stared out the front window. Her maskâs climate control system was fighting a losing battle with the carâs. She checked her kinetic power reserves on her watch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âJust turn it off,â Jakub said for the fifth time. âSet it to what you want.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGood,â she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou are so stubbââ Jakub suddenly yanked the wheel to the right hard. Calowyn braced instinctively. Two cars ahead of them a man along the side of the road had decided to cross apparently counting on speed, luck and the driversâ reflexes to get him safely to the other side of the highway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three were against the man today. The driver two cars up tried to slam on his breaks then also cut hard to the right sending him shooting off into the ditch along the side of the road. The second car responded by going left, directly into the path of the running man. Even as Jakubâs car swerved and fishtailed Calowynâs eyes automatically tracked the doomed man and the second car baring down on him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The driver and walker seemed to see each other and froze, both forgetting the carâs quarter ton of steel and fiberglass and quickly shortening distance separating them. At the last moment the runner came to his senses and tried to jump back but the car was too quick and smashed into him, sending him flying backwards. Jakub cursed again and wrestled with the wheel trying to stabilize them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âStop! Stop!â She yelled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTrying!â was all he managed through gritted teeth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He managed to break and Calowyn was out of the car before it stopped, sprinting toward the downed runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCallie!â Jakub yelled and she reflexively dodged to the side and rolled as a fourth car came screeching to a halt behind her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She jumped up and kept running. She flexed her fingers as she ran, extending her plastic retractable gloves over her hands. She slid to a halt, landing on her knees in front of the man. He was face down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn immediately checked for a pulse with her gloved fingers. It was faint but there. Should she roll him over?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The driver of the first car had run up and was now staring at the prone runner helplessly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCall Emergency Services!â She barked at the driver. Gratefully, the man began stabbing at his watch, relieved to have something to do, some sort of direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn made a decision and gingerly reached out her hands and placed them on the runnerâs side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI am going to flip you over, sir. Slowly,â she added when he waved his hands weakly at her. Was that a no or just acknowledgement? Calowyn carefully lifted the man and rolled him on his back. She leaned forward to hold him more securely to ease him down slowly. Before she could pull her hands back he grabbed her wrist. The grip was weak. He pointed at his mask.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn froze. She shook her head slowly but he nodded frantically. He mumbled something and pointed at his mask again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jakub ran up and saw the gesture. âDonât!â He said. Calowyn ignored him, though maybe it was why she did it. She reached forward with both hands and cupped the manâs face carefully. She stared into the manâs eyes a moment then her fingers felt for the releases for his mask. They clicked and she pulled it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jakub and the first driver automatically took a step backwards. Calowyn placed the mask beside the runnerâs head. His face was that of an older man, lined with the years. He might even be pre-Lockdown. His face of course, from the eyes down was more tanned than she expected. He was definitely a Pre-.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI...â she started then stopped. The man was looking at her mask. He looked into her eyes. Slowly she reached her hands toward her own mask.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jakub cursed. âNo, Callie!â But she was already touching the clasps. They released and her mask came off. The wind, she hadnât noticed it before, felt weird on her cheeks. She felt naked and exposed, but she shoved the emotions down. She was good at that. She was trained for that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runner stared at her face, her whole face, not just her eyes then looked past her into the sky. He was gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone was silent for a moment. Then Jakub yelled, âPut your damn mask on, Calowyn!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Callie did not look away from the dead runner. âHave you forgotten that you donât get to tell me what to do any longer, Jakub?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âButââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou have forgotten the face of your father,â she said . He shut his mouth and she could almost feel the shame emanating off of him. He stalked off, back towards the car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She heard the sirens of the Emergency Servicesâ vehicles in the distance. She took her mask and clipped it back into place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBut I havenât,â she said softly. She looked at the dead manâs maskâa Zarian. That was odd. She clipped his mask back into place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slowly she stood and retrieved her badge, placing it on her chest. The EMS scanners would pick it up when they were in range. The Zarianâs body would be treated with respect. That she would ensure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jakub stalked angrily to the car to retrieve his own badge. There would be a lot of paperwork today.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellory hated the rain, it was an unwelcome interruption to a day of play preplanned fun in the sunshine. She envisioned swinging on the tire swing and playing kickball with Michael and Evan in the sandy field. Now the tire swing is filling on the bottom half with big thick droplets and the field is muddy and filled with grassy puddles. She stood staring out the window gritting her teeth and mentally urging the blue gray skies to leave. She heard her mother softly knocking on her bedroom door.

"Go away" She said, adjusting slightly which made her realize she was still holding her left shoe. She had been in the middle of getting dressed for the park when the skies opened up. "Hey El, Michael and your cousin is here" Barbara said poking her nose just past the door. "Why?" Ellory said tossing her shoe into the her laundry bin. "To play silly, I thought you could make a fort downstairs or Michael said he brought the mousetrap board game" Barb explained peering into the room past the door. Ellory nodded and uncrossed her arms turning towards the door. She shot a glance back at the window speckled with rain. She grumbled and pushed her thumb to her nose.

"Hiya El, look at this, it is a little net." Evan said pushing a plastic yellow net on a notched plastic pole.

"That's cool Evan, hey Michael" Ellory huffed stomping down the stairs. Michael had a thousand yard stare and was holding the kitchen chair with a clench hand. Ellory repeated "Hey Michael". He just blinked and wobbled. He has been doing that for a few minutes, he was telling me how to play and then stopped." Evan said moving the mouse pieces to the start block. "Hey E... He... Hey Wel.. Hey Ellory" Michael stammered wobbling a bit. "Hey" Ellory said not to be put off her sour mood by Michael's inconsistencies. "Bailey" Michael shouted leaning down to pick up the tiny pup. Bailey wagged her tail and shook her butt in excitement.

"Well you wanna play your game?" Ellory said sharply.

"Yeah" Evan giggled holding to of the mice end to end.

"I was talking to Michael." Ellory stated flatly.

Michael peered over the table to see what he had brought. Mousetrap, yuck, a game of no strategy just all determining dice rolls.

"We could play a more...skilled game maybe like go fish or something." Michael squeaked.

"Why did you bring mousetrap then?" Evan demanded.

"Don't be rude Evan! But yeah why did you bring it? And it is skilled you have to avoid the nets and be good with your rolls." Ellory said pointing to a brightly colored plastic mousetrap.

"Well uhm, that you can't really be good with rolls, it's just luck. I guess I changed my mind, it is just kind of a crappy game." Michael said. Ellory and Evan gasped. Barbara peered into the kitchen from her perch on the sofa.

"Don't say the C word" Evan said sharply looking back and forth between Michael and Barbara. He wanted to separate himself from the crime and if there was a report to Daphne, he wanted his objection on the record.

"I didn't say cu...nd't play mousetrap. I mean ok, I won't say the C word, but yes also let's play mousetrap."

"Ok, I will roll first" Evan said over eager grabbing the dice and slinging them across the board.

Ellory sat down and started to let Michael's inconsistencies throw her off her sour mood.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello I am a prince from the country of Moldinavoano which is slightly 1,000 miles east of Sweden and 42 miles south of Antarctica.  I was wrongfully deposed by my cousin.  I have 100M USD in a bank account in American states but need an Americans help to retrieve it.  If you are interested in helping a good cause, defeating an evil tyranny, and making easy money quick please send an email to...

I forget how much I love Elloryâs story until I get to visit it again.  A reader will like having the inside knowledge on Michael-not-being-Michael in the stories while the other characters are out of the loop.  Also I think itâs good to show how his entrance into the past destabilizes him for a few seconds while he recalibrates.  Itâs an interesting dichotomy how he has to build the friendship as if is a kid (or whatever age he is) yet grapples with it because he naturally is beyond the things kids find interesting or funny.  I wonder if you can expand it at a later point with a pull from the other direction.  He sees something with elloryâs mother, that a kid would normally miss but he as an adult knows she is struggling with.  How to provide comfort or support when youâre a kid for something that should be over your head.  Seeing someone in pain or maybe having a success.  The mother gets a promotion and is telling an adult about it and as an adult Michael knows itâs something she got bypassed for unfairly in his
Original timeline.  He is like âthatâs great Daphne!  You have been wanting that promotion for a while!â Then everyone in the room realizes that means much more to a kid than it should.  Etc.  or maybe knows something about philandering husband and has to restrain himself (or fails to) in and adult conversation setting like a dinner party going on in the next room.

I also like the addition of friends.  I canât remember if this particular one comes in later when they are older.  Or if there is bad blood when they are older and it colors michaels actions now.  Or vice versa she likes him and he is trying to put a stop to it now (but finds out in the future he only made it worse).

Also like the emotional connection the reader gets to Ellory with the rain.  What does it say about life that kids have to work to stay mad while adults have to work to stay happy?  Not sure if Ellory is just upset from the rain or if it is because something else is going on with her at this time and the rain reminds her/doesnât allow her to ignore it with playing with friends outside etc.  if the latter maybe a quick comment / reference in to give the reader a hint about it.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To make a long story short, Dick Parnell (or "Prattling Parnell" as Michelle had named him) was a man of few words.Â  He had always been a man of few words.Â  Seldom was the day that you got any out of him.Â  The few you got were often clipped as if each syllable was gold and he was doling it out like a miser.Â  If he could use a contraction he would, if two words would suffice he would find a way to use one.

When his wife of 40 years had died on the operating table he had called each of his grandchildren individually,Â  said "Meemaw's not coming home," and hung up.Â  Â Dick Parnell did not waste time on good-byes.Â  The grandchildren would tell their parents when they got home that night.

Then Dick had gone out to weed his extensive garden ("Plants're quiet").Â  The grandchildren who had been unlucky enough to pick up the phone when he called were either reduced to great heaving sobs (Estelle had been a favorite grandparent to many).Â  Others just gave a "cool" and then they went back to their video game, or comic, or phone call with their friends on the other line (because old people tended to die a lot).Â  His children had frantically begun calling each other, trying to piece together the details, as the stories and half answers were pried from sobbing kids, sullen teenagers, and the irritated hospital staff.

Jersey Winn, Parnell's oldest granddaughter, lived in New York City.Â  That was a place Dick hated to think about.Â  He could hear all the noise of the place just through the phone line when Jersey called.Â  She called a lot.Â  She wanted him to visit New York City.Â  What he did not know was that his granddaughter suspected he would kick her lazy ass husband in the butt and tell him to get a job.Â  Dick would inadvertently broach an uncomfortable subject--that the Joey Winn's business, whatever it was this month, wasn't taking off and maybe it was time to get a real job.Â  Then she and Joey could have a heart to heart.Â  (Joey Winn's business was actually selling marijuana, but even in that he had only been able to get one customer.Â  Still it covered his own use so why expend unnecessary energy.)

Parnell only called during the day because Jersey was at work and so would not be there to pick up the phone.Â  Her idiot husband let it ring through to the message machine usually, so Parnell just needed to suffer through the 15 seconds from Jersey telling him to leave a message that she would get back "right quick".Â  And she did.Â  Jersey always called back, always talked a mile a minute, always held Parnell on the phone for hours while she chatted away about everything and nothing.Â  Â Though he would never admit it to himself Jersey was the only one he liked in the entire family, including his own kids.Â  She was never offended because he grunted responses.Â  She never cared that he had nothing to say.Â  Truth be told, if he thought he could have handled New York City, he would have gone there and punched her druggie husband right in the gut and told him to "Get a job or get out!".Â  A lot a words but sometimes you had to spend them out to get through to chuckleheads like Joey.Â  'Course Jersey still being with the louse was living proof that hundreds of thousands of words didn't get through to some people.

Parnell did not think about Jersey if he could because more than once he had found himself at the bus station looking at the ticket counter.Â  The garden store was right across from the depot.Â  His feet just seemed to take him there sometimes.

Unfortunately, for Joey Winn on this particular day he had picked up the phone when Parnell called with the news about Estelle.Â  Joey had been waiting for a call from his dealer and was annoyed to hear the gravely voice of his nagging wife's grandfather on the line.Â  Joey had been to Jersey's hometown once, right after they got married, since they could not afford a honeymoon (until his reusable sheetrock business took off).Â  It had been a rotten trip and he had only been able to score some overpriced skank weed off of Jersey's teenage cousin.Â  It barely got him high.Â  The old man, Prattling Parnell (who came up with the nickname), did not say two words to him, only stared at him like he wanted to punch Joey.Â  Punch him a couple of times in fact.Â  Jersey doted on the crotchety old man even though the rest of the family clearly saw what Joey did.Â  He was a Grade A butt face.

"Meemaw's not coming home," the Grade A butt face said through the phone.

Joey was a little slow this morning.Â  "Huuuuhhh?" he said.

Dick Parnell paused mid-hang up.Â  The idiot husband hadn't got the message.Â  G.D. junkies!Â  Maybe he should just hang up.Â  Jersey and Estelle hadn't liked each other for some reason Parnell had never been able to figure out.Â  Still if anyone deserved to not be the last to know family business it was Jersey.Â  She was...different.Â  Parnell spent a lot of time in the garden or out walking his land, yet still he always happened to be near the phone when she called.Â  For the briefest of seconds, he wondered if there was something to that.Â  Did he have a favorite?

Well, he had sat there more than once, listening while she cried herself empty in loud New York City.Â  Grunted negatively when she chastised herself for being weak--which by God she wasn't.Â  Not at all!Â  Most of the people in the town--including him--never moved away.Â  Dreams, ambitions, all of it came and went.Â  Getting out of the town was like swimming through molasses.Â  Failing to get out was practically a right of passage.Â  Still she did it and she kept at it even though he knew the draw to come back was always strong.Â  Not weak at all.Â  No, sir.

Dick Parnell reached deep down inside himself for the strength to deal with her idiot husband.Â  He gathered up one more, completely unnecessary, completely wasted word.

"Dead," he said, then hung up.

Joey Winn stared at the phone as his mind tried to process.Â  Who was dead?Â  As soon as he put down the phone it rang.Â  He picked it up tentatively.Â  Had the old Grade-A called back?

"Hello?" Joey said cautiously.

"Joey Winn.Â  Winn you been, man?"

Joey sighed with relief.Â  It was his best (and only) customer, Craig.Â  They had grown up together but now the guy was a local politician like in the State Senate or city planning or something.Â  Maybe Craig was an actual Senator for New York.Â  No wait that was...Â  Joey had seen Craig on TV.Â  He did not sound like he did when he called Joey.Â  There he sounded official and serious, talking about the dangers of "drugs in our community".Â  Maybe he liked Joey because he knew Joey was not a cop.

"I think somebody died," Joey said.Â  "Jersey's family," he added quickly.Â  "No one important.Â  I think."

"Okay," Craig said after a minute.Â  "Cool.Â  Well, let's talk business, baby.Â  Oh and how's that hot wife of yours?"

"Funny," Joey muttered.Â  "You want the usual amount?"]]></content:encoded>

The description of doling out syllables like a miser deals out gold really sets up Dick as a curmudgeon. But then we get this sweet story about how Jersey is his favorite and how despite his characteristic brevity he really cares about her and thinks a lot about her. I like the pothead husband with one customer, he is kind of like the facebook friend who doesn't have their shit together so you look at their profile when you need to know someone is more of a fuckup. I think, and I know there are so many stories you could write so so well, but I think a story about a family would really fit your style well. I wanna sit in a room with Dick and her his response to shenanigans. So much back story on these people, I will for the briefest of moments some time in the future have to discern if I know someone who is incredibly terse with a pothead sun in law or if I am remembering this story. It has such a real vibe to it, it feels so much like a personal story. And I know it is, but it comes off so well. In some ways I think there was some processing about who this person is past their exterior, and maybe, some assignment of thoughts and feelings where they cannot readily be identified, sorta like filling in the gaps with this person but also who do you want them to be.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jersey was tired as she trudged down the walk toward her apartment.Â  The bus had broken down.Â  It was hot and the other bus took--well, complaining was not going to help, Jersey thought to herself.Â  She had a job.Â  She was healthy.Â  A lot of people had it worse than her.

She knew that because she carted them to and from work, to and from the doctors, to and from their lives.Â  Route 216, driver 3931, that was the 30 feet of steel Jersey kept clean, safe and happy for her riders. A lot of the other drivers did not like her she knew.Â  Jersey always showed up to work an hour early to clean her assigned bus for the day.Â  She rubbed down the surfaces with antibacterial wipes since a lot of her mid-day riders were elderly.Â  The cleaning crew missed a lot of common area surfaces.Â  Sometimes the seats of that day's bus had tears in them which could catch on skirts or hosiery so she tapped them up with duct tape.

This afternoon she had organized the younger riders to fan the older ones in the sweltering heat.Â  That she just happened to place Sally Pertikins and Fred (he never gave a last name) together to fan Mrs. Evelyn (husband deceased 3 years) was just a coincidence.Â  That Jersey had watched Sally shoot furtive glances at Fred for months now and that Fred was getting over a bad divorce (because his wife cheated on him) was also not relevant to who she assigned where.Â  Mrs. Evelyn seemed to think differently though because she smiled conspiratorially at Jersey and winked when Sally and Fred got paired up.Â  Fred was a favorite.

Once Fred's ex-wife had had the audacity to use 216 to get to and from the apartment of the jerk she was cheating on Fred with!Â  Mrs. Evelyn (wears purple on days she feels good) had accidentally tripped the jerk cheater once while he was getting on the bus, causing him to break his nose and sprain his wrist.Â  He tried to get off, but Jersey unfortunately had a "route to keep" and she could not open the doors while the bus was moving or make unauthorized stops just for him.Â  She accidentally missed all of her stops after that and it took an hour of "searching" for her to find the where she had gotten lost.

The poor jerkface cheater had grumbled the whole way, but Fred's cheating wife had gotten the message.Â  Looking around for sympathizers at this crazy bus driver she had only found cold stares.Â  Mrs. Evelyn had sweetly asked after Fred, leaving no doubt in the cheater wife's mind what was going on.Â  Jersey had gotten in trouble for that one and quite a few of her route passengers that had gotten missed or picked up late.Â  They were angry the next day when they boarded the bus.Â  But by the time they got off no one was mad.Â  Mr. Bowinger even said being late to work had been a blessing because he had run into an old friend on the replacement bus that was sent to pick him them all up.Â  Not one person was mad at her by the time they got off the bus.Â  A few even laughed about hoping she "did not stay too late cleaning up blood stains" and winking at her.

The written reprimand for Jersey's permanent file never came though.Â  Her supervisor had been angry about that.Â  "Perfect Prattling Jersey got away with it somehow," she had overheard her boss gripe in the breakroom.Â  Sometimes a girl just got lucky.

Jersey had wondered about her favorite city councilman, but he had not been on this week.Â  Craig was a once-a-week rider though she knew he lived in a different part of the city.Â  She was careful around him because he was the head of the Transportation Board and her upper management were terrified of upsetting him.Â  He was an odd one, always rode to the same stop and was there for pick up the next time she rolled up.Â  He said he had a friend nearby, probably a woman knowing these politicians.Â  He was probably theÂ  nightmare for some other "Fred".

Jersey stopped at the trash can beside the stoop and lifted the lid.Â  A common complaint the tenants had with the City was that the garbage crew disputed whether it was their responsibility to walk up the steps and empty the can.Â  Jersey hated conflict so she had decided to just do it herself.Â  No one ever used it except the smokers to toss their cigarette butts in and as she lifted the lid up she saw that apparently been a while since anyone--tenant or crew--had emptied it.Â  Jersey slammed the can lid down and covered it instinctively.Â  There was a little baggie of marijuana in there.Â  She knew Joey smoked marijuana but she could not imagine he would be tossing it in here.Â  Especially not a full baggie's worth.Â  That stuff was gold to him.

She looked around and then opened the lid, there were actually two bags in there.Â  She pulled off the lid and moved a few of the butts around with her umbrella (always be prepared, Dick Parnell Rule 101).Â  She found more.Â  A lot more.Â  It took her twenty minutes of digging but she found almost 18 bags.Â  She tried to think back.Â  Those had not been in there the last time she had emptied the can.Â  Or had they?Â  She thought back to when she had last emptied the can.Â  Since it was only cigarette butts and the odd can of soda here and there it took a while to fill up.Â  Eighteen bags, eighteen weeks.Â  Jersey had seen cop shows and knew sometimes drug dealers left drugs at "pick up" spots.Â  Surely Joey was not so stupid as to have his dealers drop off his drugs in front of their home--no, and besides Joey would have collected these by now.Â  They must belong to someone else.

Jersey quickly gathered up the bags and dashed around to the back of the apartment building.Â  As she expected, Woody, the homeless guy who sometimes slept on the back stoop was there.Â  He looked up suddenly when she came running around then relaxed when she saw it was her.

"You got a sandwich for me, little Miss?" he chuckled.

She ran up to him, close to him, "Woody, I need help!"

She was uncomfortably close she knew, Woody did not like to be touched.Â  She had once seen him fight three police officers trying to take him away to a shelter on one brutally cold night.Â  If she had not offered to ride in the back of the police car with him and get him settled in at the shelter she doubted he would have gone.

"Wha--"

"Look down my shirt!" she said.Â  His jaw dropped.Â  "Please, everyone already thinks you're a pervert," she begged.

"My damn belt broke--"

"Please," she said again looking around and up at the windows of the apartments surrounding the small entry way.

Slowly, he pulled her shirt forward and looked down then jumped back.

"That's a lot of weed there, girl.Â  You need a lot more breasts to all hide that."

"Hey!" she said, the drug momentarily forgotten.Â  Her cup size was a sore subject between her and Joey.Â  So much so that she had considered getting breast implants like her grandmother Estelle was...actually should have gotten earlier this morning.Â  Jersey made a mental note to call her grandfather and check on her grandmother.

"I need you to get rid of these," she said.

"You want me to take those?" Woody said, carefully.Â  "Can I look down your shirt again?"

"No!" Jersey said.

"I need to check you for a wire," he said.Â  "You could be narc-ing me out.Â  Maybe your boy, Joey, got caught dealing and you're selling up a bigger fish."

Jersey stared at Woody blankly.Â  Dealing?Â  Joey didn't deal.Â  Did he?

"Fine, check," Jersey said.Â  "Then take these and get rid of them."

Woody checked, a bit longer than Jersey thought necessary, but once he was satisfied he held his hands out for the drugs.

"Thank you!" she said gratefully.Â  "I owe you one."

"I think we're more than even, little Miss," Woody winked.Â  He trotted off whistling.

When she got into her apartment Jersey closed the door and leaned on it exhausted.Â  Between work and the frantic energy of the last few minutes she was spent.Â  A hot bath was definitely in her future.

"Hey, babe," Joey said, not looking up from the marijuana cigarette he was rolling.

"You won't believe the day I had, baby," Jersey said.Â  Maybe, just maybe she could get a backrub out of him.

"Umhmm," Joey said.Â  He reached for a lighter and lit his marijuana cigarette.

"The bus broke down and we had to wait for Sanjiv's 218 to get rerouted and I found 18 G.D bags of marijuana in the trash can outside."

That got his attention.Â  Joey's head shot up.Â  "What?Â  Where?Â  Outside?"

"Yes! Can you bel--" Joey was up and moving before she even had time to register it.Â  She barely managed to out of his way before he tore the door open.

"Baby!Â  Baby!Â  Wait, it's gone, it's gone!"

He was halfway out the door.Â  He spun around.Â  "Wait?!Â  How?"

Jersey waived him closer since he was standing in the hall.Â  "I gave it to Woody to get rid of."

He stared at her dumbstruck.Â  "Woody, the bum?"Â  She nodded and his face changed.Â  "You stupid idiot!Â  Do you know how much that was worth?"

Jersey stared at him.Â  "Baby, that is not nice."Â  Joey visibly struggled to restrain himself.

"Fine, which way did he go?Â  Maybe I can get him to give me half," Joey said.Â  He reached inside for his shoes by the door.

"Joey," Jersey said.Â  "Are you a dealer?"

Joey looked up but did not stop tying his shoes.Â  "What?Â  No.Â  Well, to one guy but he's an old friend."

"Do you deal to kids?" Jersey asked.

"No, just one guy.Â  I just charge him enough of a margin to cover my own weed expenses," Joey said.Â  He stood.Â  "Which way did Woody go?"

Margin? Expenses?Â  Joey had a business degree from college but he had never used those words in any conversation with her.Â  "You've put a lot of thought into that business," she said softly.

"Which way did Woody go, Jerz?Â  Hey, wake up, McFly.Â  This is important!"

Jersey slugged him in the stomach.Â  Hard.Â  Jersey had never hit anyone before in her life and she felt guilt the second she did it.Â  She opened her mouth to apologize.

Joey was on the ground, clutching his stomach.Â  "I'm glad your grandfather's dead, you bitch!"

Jersey's words died on her tongue.Â  She only had one living grandfather.Â Â "What?"

Joey waived his hand towards the apartment.Â  "Earlier.Â  Call.Â  Gees, you punched me, Jerz!"

Jersey turned around and closed the door.Â  She locked the deadbolt and shoved the lock plate into place.Â  She walked over to the couch and sat down.Â  Grampy Parnell dead.Â  Joey had returned the punch with interest.Â  Interest, she thought, that is a business word I know.Â  I'm not stupid.

Outside she could her Joey pounding on the door.Â  The phone rang.Â  It would be her father, maybe, or her mother calling to talk about Grampy.Â  Probably to gloat.Â  They all hated him for some reason.Â  She let the answering machine get it as she and started locking all the windows.Â  Her own chirpy voice nattered out of the speaker at her then a man's voice came on.Â  Strangely familiar.

"Yo, Winn, it's Craig.Â  I can't make it out today, dude.Â  Bus never showed.Â  Just hold my stash til tomorrow.Â  Better watch that hot little wife of yours."

Jersey picked up the phone.Â  "Who is this?"

"Jersey?" the man said, all 'street' attitude gone.Â  He sounded shocked and a little scared.

"Is this Craig...from the bus?Â  From the City?"

And suddenly all the pieces came together.Â  The weekly rides, always taking the standing spot near the front "because he sat too much all day", the constant attempts to make her laugh, that he was a recent divorcee like Fred and so he "sympathized with the poor bastard", the discarded drugs outside.Â  Even the lack of reprimand at work.

"You don't even smoke marijuana, do you?" she said.

"No," he said.Â  "Not since I was a 16."

"Kids could have gotten those," she said.

"I know, but I couldn't figure out a way to--"

"That was really irresponsible," she said.Â  She tried to picture his face from the bus.Â  He was not a frequent rider so it too a moment.

He was silent, waiting.Â  "I'm sorry," he said finally.Â  "That was reckless."

"How long have you been doing it?" she asked.Â  Jersey sat down on the couch.Â  Joey was still in the hall yelling and pounding on the door in the background.Â  She would have to address that soon.

"Four years," Craig said.Â  He sounded sad.Â  Jersey looked down over the table of drugs and cigarette rolling supplies.

"I'm calling the police," she yelled at Joey.Â  The pounding and yelling stopped.

"Okay," Craig said simply, "I understand.Â  How much was there?"

She started to tell him she was talking to Joey then instead just said "about 20 bags.

Craig whistled.Â  "Yes, that will be some time."Â  He sighed.Â  "Okay.Â  I need to take responsibility.Â  Here, I'll give you my address so you can tell the Police where--"

"I got rid of the bags," she said.Â  "I gave them to a homeless guy I know."

"That was really irresponsible," he said and she could tell he was smiling.Â  She smiled.

"Do you want to get laid?" Jersey said suddenly.

"With you?" he said hopefully then groaned.Â  She could tell he regretted that comment and for some reason that made her smile even wider.

"Be here in 20 minutes," she said and hung up without saying goodbye.

She would have to deal with Joey.Â  She would have to call her cheating jerk grandmother who was probably already out using her new breast implants if Grampy was dead.Â  She would probably be out even if he was alive.

"Woody went towards 54th," she yelled.Â  After a moment Joey stomped off, presumably to get his "gold".

Of course, Jersey reflected, she was still a married woman and about to have a man over that was not her husband.Â  So maybe she and Estelle were not so different.Â  I told you I wasn't strong like you, Grampy.Â  She wished suddenly Grampy could have met Mrs. Evelyn.

Jersey stood up, realizing she was still in her bus driver's uniform.Â  She needed a dress.Â  And a shower.Â  And maybe, yes, yes, that one bit of lingerie she had bought but never gotten around to wearing for Joey.

Craig was just a distraction.Â  Probably.Â  She would have to deal with Grampy's death, Joey, all it but not tonight.Â  She unplugged the phone and turned off the answering machine.

She smiled as she pulled lingerie out of her drawer.Â  They were gold, too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Dude this is by far the creepiest place we have ever broken into, including the old hospital" Rodney said his voice quivering as he hunched beneath a row of bushes.

"Relax, I have been in here before, it is just the old middle school, my cousin was in a play here before it closed" Daniel said shoving his way through the bushes. A single light illuminated the pale windowed double doors leading to the old school assembly hall. The hall was dark inside and looking in the only thing visible was a poster for a retirement party long past.

"There you dorks are!" Michelle said walking on the side walk by the parking lot. "Why are you in the bushes? There is no one here, like ever, Frank Upman used to bring me here in his car." Michelle looked over to a parking spot with potholes by a long forgotten but very full dumpster. Daniel winced a little bit thinking about Michelle with "Frank the Tank". "Get your head down, this ain't just some poorly chosen hookup spot, we found this in the code from some culty whacko's" Rodney said still hunched behind the bush. "Ok, one, don't tell me what to do, second, this is a fine hookup spot and third, if any one steps to me they got another thing coming." Michelle said pulling her hoodie over her head and crossing her arms. Rodney turned to whisper to Daniel "Listen, I know you like her, and I will NEVER understand why, but if she gets us killed it is on you!" Rodney said to Dan in cavern of thick green leaves. "What! Why is it my fault, she is not my wife or something." Dan exhaled. "You wish you masochist." Rodney said pushing Dan's shoulder. "Ok, maybe Michelle is right, we have been all over and nothing has happened to us, maybe we are just worried for no real thing?" Dan reasoned. "Hey I know I told you it was a good hookup spot but can you do that another time?" Michelle yelled.

"Will you keep your voice down!" Rodney whispered as loudly as he could popping up above the bushes eyes stretched wide. A slow roll of car lights rolled over Rodney in the bushes turning towards the parking lot. The crackle of tires on gravel broke the silence and the crickets stopped chirping in the distance. Light fell on Michelle who turned towards the car frozen in the middle of a wide clear stretch. Rodney ducked down back into the bushes and crawled over towards Dan who was on his hands and knees peering out. The car rolled towards Michelle and stopped a few feet from her. From where Rodney and Dan were hiding they could only make out the shape of the car, a sedan, dark green or maybe blue. A car door opened and the light from the car was obscured by a figuring moving towards Michelle. "HeY..!" Michelle said but was quickly muffled. Dan prepared to stand up but Rodney grabbed his shoulder. "Look!" he said pointing towards a dimly lit second figure by the car holding a short barreled shotgun. A red dot shown like a laser as the man with the gun scanned the lot. One car door slammed, then another, then another. The lights began to roll over the bushes as the car turned around in the parking lot. "C'mon Dan, we gotta get to our bikes!" Rodney said in a hurry. "What we can't just leave her! I love her I am going after them!" Dan whispered shoving his sleeves back. "I know lover boy, we gotta head off the car and see those tags! They gotta turn by the football field, if we hurry we can get there before they do."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow!  When you come out of temporary writing tupor  you come out swinging!! :)

That just kicked the plot into overdrive.  Now I am on the edge of my seat to see what you do.  So many possibilities!!  Do the guy accidentally stop the car by jumping the bikes into the windshield.  Does Michelle get taken.  Do they get the license plate and if so what about the crooked sheriff?  (Which brings up another point.  All the bad guys or corrupt people in town donât have to be a part of the cult.  The sheriff could be corrupt for entirely different reasons and unaware of the cult.)  Or do the guys completely fail Michelle and donât get the license plate?  Then have to use the resources theyâve built up since being a part of the ASMC?

Iâm glad you wrote this this way. I tend to do a lot of character description and situational character development, and I forget that sometimes the best way to do character development is based on the actions they do different situations.  Also this opens up the possibility for a disagreement over the appropriate actions by Daniel and Rodney. And then the testing of the friendship versus Daniels attraction to Michelle.

As always I like the banter between the group.  In the group dynamics and internal conflicts each of them house. I think we can play with Rodneyâs conflict more.  Every time I read or write him and especially after reading this pieceâand thinking about action response to conflict defining characterâI wonder what we need to do to expand his character. We know what makes them tick and their gifts but what are their conflicts?  Weâve got TJ with his clumsiness versus everyone thinking heâs violent because it looks like heâs destroying things. Intentionally.

Daniell with his constant love sick/ love driven thing.  Michelle with her natural inclination to be mean and cutting but maybe fighting it or poking at it wondering why sheâs doing it, almost as is discovering she is a stereotype, a flat character living in a 3-D world, being forced into that. We know thatâs true And that the demigod is doing it, but Maybe as his unknowing priestess he has less power over her thank he realizes.

But Rodney still seems to be hanging out there. Next time we talk Letâs focus on him Maybe.  And Iâll try working him up In the character matrix better]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glasses clinked and a few people clapped. Some of the ladies tittered, one or two of the divorcees a little louder than necessary. Randy was really laying it on thick with his best man speech while wait staff unobtrusively slipped between the tables, clearing plates and swapping out drinks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One unfortunate waiter had tried to relieve Sam of her half eaten chocolate wedding cake. Sure it was just the frosting left but damned if she did not feel she had earned it. Damned if some trumped up artsy-fartsy hippie was going to come away with all of his fingers if he reached for her plate again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had placed her knife possessively point down in front of the plate. A promise of murder in her eyes. Hippie Joe had wisely retreated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These were not thoughts that normally ran through her head. Sam was about as proper as they came. She was some might even say...meek? No, not meek, Sam just did not see the point of conflict. It was messy. Sam did not do messes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not meek...agreeable. Yes, Sam was agreeable. Which is how she ended up caving when her sister lobbied day after day for her âbaby sis, Sammieâ to come down see her favorite (read: only) sister get married.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At any other time, in any other place, Sam would have been thrilled to be a part of Katelynâs big day. A part of the whole experience from dive bar crawl to bachelorette party/limousine last hurrah.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Sam was pregnant. Not get-this-alien-out-of-me-or-so-help-me-God-I-will-reach-down-your-throat-and-rip-out-your-spleen pregnant. But pregnant enough that the summer heat sucked, her husband Zackâs lease on life was tentative, and the last place she should be was at this stupid wedding, watching her stupid sister get married. Watching the whitest whiteboy ever Randy blubber about how much he âloved his home slice Robbieâ (Samâs future brother-in-law) and Robbieâs new wife âKatie-Kateâ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam gritted her teeth to the polite and slightly drunk laughter as Randy dragged through one stupid story after another. Katie-Kate? What kind of sadist gives someone two nicknames? Maybe Randy had wanted Katie-Kate to scrammy-scram away from his home slice brotherhood. Randy was out of Robbieâs house and Kate was in and now Randy was the last hommie in âthe crewâ living with his parents at 31.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam took a deep breath and tried to relax. Unkind thoughts were not what she needed. Numerous studies had shown that stress and negativity directly impacted the baby. This was in the 23rd, 31st, and 54th book that she had read on pregnancy after she had gotten that little pink â+â symbol seven months ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The baby was clearly in agreement with this. During the wedding ceremony, he had been alternating between kicking her vital organs and sending her gas to pass on his behalf to tell the party goers what he thought of the whole affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam had begged Katelyn to push back the wedding. This date had been cursed from the beginning. The minister who had originally been slated to do the wedding had discovered Buddha or Mohammed or something. Making a phone call to let someone know however seemed to be contrary to his newly found religion because he had just skipped town. Sam had been the one to discover itâalways checking behind everyone else, she had uncovered that little land mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There had been no other ministers available that day or during the month (small town problems).  Then the florist had gotten a big commercial contract with the town for Founderâs Day (which was also today coincidentally). The original venue had gotten flooded requiring Robbie and Kate either to choose another date a few months from Founders Day or switch to this giant sweltering tent outside. The tent had won out.  And then the heat wave had come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had started in early March. The church had called and let Katie-Kate and home slice Robbie know that even the most conservative weathermen and meteorologists were calling for this month and specifically this day to be the hottest it had been in over 100 years. Could they be convinced to move out a month or two when the flooding would be taken care of or the weather would be cooler? No? What if the venue lowered its rates by 25%?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, it had to be this date. GOD HAD DECREED IT. Somewhere Samâs usually rational sister had gone batshit crazy along with her husband. God wanted it to be this day. How only Rob and Kate knew but that was their answer to everything. God apparently was as selfish as Kate. No, Sam, chided herself. That was not fair or nice and definitely not proper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When news of the heat wave came Sam had called Kate and said she might not be able to make the wedding. One thing all 77 pregnancy books had universally agreed on (Sam had marked the page or chapter in each) was that extreme temperatures were strongly advised against after the sixth month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That brought down the Hell Fire. Things were said. Mostly by Kate, some by Robbie who was sitting next to Kate now that they were âa Holy unit of Godâ. Sam had been the one who decided to get pregnant the year Robbie proposed. (Technically Robbie proposed two weeks after Sam broke the news, but why quibble over small details). </p>

<p>Katelyn had always been there for Sam. Hadnât Katelyn dropped out of college and moved in with Sam to help her out with the rent (and also to pursue acting, but that was a side venture)? Who had helped out with the rent when Sam was struggling to make ends meet? (Technically Sam was struggling because Kate ate and drank her way through Samâs entire paycheck while they were living together). Who...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDoesnât she just look lovely?â said a voice to Samâs right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes,â Sam said automatically.  She had said yes to the same question 12 times tonight already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat a dear!â That was Ms. Flannigan. Eighty-nine years young with a memory like a steel trap. (If that steel trap had rusted shut five decades ago.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam still had no idea which side of the family Ms. Flannigan belonged to. But having a shown total lack of foresight getting pregnant had left Sam relegated to the back table with the crazy spinsters. That had been another point of contention. Sam could not be at the main table because it would be directly in the hot sun for the first part of dinner and why bother shuffling everyone and moving one the meal had started just because the sun was down? That had left the divorcee table, the âkidâ table, and bridesmaids table open. The rest of the tables had been divided between the two families like Hatfield and McCoy territory. 150 people in perfectly placed in orbit around the main table, distance from the wedding party based on who had pissed Robbie and Katelyn off the least (and who had kissed their ass the most).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDoesnât she just look lovely?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms. Flannigan had been the lesser of the evils. Sam was too old to be with the kids (read: snarky teenagers), too married to be with the divorcees. She was too pregnant to be with the bridesmaids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last thing anyone wanted was to be reminded of the potential consequences of a drunken one night stand. People came to weddings to get laid! Seeing the Miracle of Life waddling around in front of them might deprive one of the bridesmaids of the opportunity to wake up the next morning, frantically searching for their heels and underwear.  Weddings gave good girls an excuse to throw off the shackles of sense and decorum.  Like how no one could criticize a girl for how she dressed (only) on Halloween, weddings were a hall pass to the bad girlâs bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat a dear!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes,â Sam muttered through clenched teeth as the baby gave her an expertly placed shot to the kidneys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the head table, her husband Zack, noticing what he thought was her grin, winked at her. Sam genuinely smiled and winked back. Zack was a good guy. Had he not agreed to do the ceremony it might have never happened. Good old Zack. He drove two states over to this small nowhere town every weekend for two months to meet with Robbie and Katelyn and their new minister who was unfortunately booked up today, Founders Day. Good. Old. Zack. How had Sam let Katelyn talk her and Zack into that craziness.  The same way she always had.  A concerted guilt ridden full court press coordinated between Samâs mother, father, and Katelyn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam stabbed at her cake maybe a little harder than necessary. Zack. Who did not even know Robbie at all and Kate who he did not known other than from Sam and Zackâs wedding last year and the random family gathering.  Zack.  Willing to give up his weekends, her weekends actually...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms. Flannigan signaled a passing waiter for more cake. She raised two fingers at his unspoken question and he nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOh, I donâtââ Sam started but the man had already moved on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPregnant,â Ms. Flannigan said and reached forward to pat Samâs protruding belly. That was the sum total of the interaction so far between Sam and Ms. Flannigan. âLovelyâ, âwhat a dearâ, and âpregnantâ followed by a belly rub. (Why did everyone think it was okay to touch pregnant women. Even her new father-in-law loved that game no matter how hard Sam tried to dodge and discreetly swivel away.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes, I am STILL pregnant,â Sam said. âTechnically, 5 minutes more pregnant than the last time you patted my stomach.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms. Flannigan smiled like she did not have a care in the world or thought in her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam looked around. Randy looked like he was winding down. She mentally sighed and took her notes out of her purse. She had worked on the speech for the last week, fiddling with it so that it really showed how much she loved Katelyn. How lucky she hoped Robbie knew he was. There were no jokes in the speech, though. Sam had seen that go embarrassingly bad in the past (recently if you counted Randyâs speech). Her own wedding had had more than a few uncomfortable moments from half-drunk speeches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSomeone should punch that cunt in the throat,â Ms. Flannigan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The âYesâ was almost automatically out of Samâs mouth but the sip she had just taken from her watered-down, non-alcoholic Hotty Toddy managed to beat it. Sam spluttered out her drink.  Her words were drowned out by the applause as Randy finished his speech. He and Robbie and some of the groomsmen exchanged high fives and two even did a jumping chest bump. One part of Samâs mind tried to mentally calculate whether that would raise or lower their stock with the bridesmaids. But the rest of her brain was fully focused on saying: âWhat did you just say?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She never got the chance. From behind her out of the loud speaker came her new father-in-lawâs slurred voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSam, why donât you waddle on up here and say a few words.â That got a few laughs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam stared dumbly at Ms. Flannigan who stared back at her with the same vacant, vapid look she had had all night. The waiter arrived with the two plates of cake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><p>âNow, Sam, honey, that cake will be there all night but Robbie and Katie need to get on the road before too long."</p><p>The crowd howled with laughter.&nbsp; Sam turned around, trying to gather her scattered thoughts and waved the cake away with a sheepish grin.&nbsp; She clutched her speech notes to her side and began to try to weave her way through the cluttered tables and chairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Katelyn stood up, concern in her eyes.&nbsp; "Sam, it's ok--"</p><p>"I'll get her the mic," Don, her father-in-law said with only a touch of petulance.&nbsp; Don drank.&nbsp; He treated it like an extreme sport so moving after he got started was a bit of an imposition and that was clear in his movements as he headed towards Sam.&nbsp; Determined not to be a burden Sam pushed forward through the last sets of chairs and tables and met Don at the center of the room.&nbsp; He handed her the mic and headed back to his seat, signaling for another drink as he walked.</p><p>Sam spoke into the mic.&nbsp; "I couldn't let--" She stopped and moved it away as the feedback came blaring through the speakers.&nbsp; "Sorry," she said.</p><p>And then everything went pear-shaped.</p></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["I couldn't let my favorite sister get married without me saying a few words," Sam said.&nbsp; She waited but no one laughed.&nbsp; A bead of sweat trickled down the side of her face joining the other 500 that had already made that trip to the scratchy collar of her dress.&nbsp; That had been her one and only joke and it had flopped.&nbsp; Even Katelyn looked unimpressed and it was their inside joke!

Sam looked down.&nbsp; The baby's incessant kicking had stopped.&nbsp; For one horrible panicky moment she wondered if the heat--but, no, when she put her hand to her stomach she could feel his heart beat strong and true as always.&nbsp; No feeling of&nbsp;<em>wrongness</em>.&nbsp; Still she thought <em>What am I doing here?&nbsp; I don't even like half of these people.</em>&nbsp; That was not kind.&nbsp; Sam centered herself, looked down at her speech notes and opened her mouth, but nothing came out.

"Today!" someone yelled.&nbsp; Sam really hated what alcohol did to some people.

Why was she here?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>To support your sister who loves you</em>.&nbsp; That was her mother's voice.&nbsp; Sam knew it well.&nbsp; It sounded like her own voice.&nbsp; But as she looked helplessly around the room she realized she could not make her voice come.

Don stood up to retrieve the microphone.&nbsp; "Baby brain," he said to the crowd by way of explanation. That got them going.&nbsp; Everyone was laughing now.&nbsp; Sam blushed.

No, no, not everyone.&nbsp; Sam's eyes met Ms. Flanigann's, but they did not seem vacant and vapid now.&nbsp; They were sharp and intelligent, piercing.&nbsp; The ancient woman did not smile now.&nbsp; Instead she leaned back in her chair, watching.&nbsp; Sam heard the last words Ms. Flanigann had said to her in her head again.&nbsp; She snickered the way a child caught doing something wrong would even though Sam knew that language was not lady-like language.&nbsp; She turned away to collect herself and found Katelyn staring at her.&nbsp; Sam gave her a weak, apologetic smile.

"Sorry, I screwed up your stupid, hot wedding, Katie-Kate," Sam said.&nbsp; The room erupted into more laughter.&nbsp; Sam blanched.&nbsp; What had she just said?&nbsp; Katelyn gave her a strained smile.

"I am glad I came," Sam said, recovering.&nbsp; "It's not often I get to drive 500 miles to pay to drink watered down beer and sweat my ass off."

Katelyn's smile Became even more brittle.

<em>Oh God</em>, Sam thought.&nbsp; <em>I am embarrassing her.&nbsp; The heat.&nbsp; It is the heat</em>.

Don was standing in front of her, his hand reaching towards the microphone, stupid smile plastered on his face.&nbsp; Sam took an involuntary step backward.

"Don, you're still vertical!?"&nbsp; Sam said.&nbsp; Don's hand stopped in mid-grab as the crowd erupted into laughter again.&nbsp; He suddenly looked like a deer caught in the headlights.&nbsp; Don made the jokes--he was not the butt of them.

"Frankly, I thought you'd be tits up in a field pissing yourself by this point."&nbsp; Sam waived at one of the waiters.&nbsp; "Get this man a drink!&nbsp; STAT!!"

Don seemed to shrivel in on himself as the laughter rolled around the room like thunder.&nbsp; A few of the groomsmen fell out of their chairs.

<em>Holy Banana Sandwich!&nbsp; I am funny!</em>&nbsp; Sam thought.&nbsp; In front of her, Don took an unsteady step back and then walked woodenly to his seat.

"That is the best I'm-Not-Drunk-Walk I've ever seen, Don.&nbsp; Do you practice that every night on the side of the road?&nbsp; I bet the blue lights really bring out your complexion," Sam could not stop herself.&nbsp; She could see out of the corner of her eye that Robbie looked pissed.&nbsp; He was staring daggers at her.&nbsp; <em>It's not my fault!</em> she wanted to scream to him.&nbsp;<em> I can't stop</em>!

Sam was right.&nbsp; She really could not stop.&nbsp; Her eyes searched the room frantically for help as her voice rang out again over the loud speaker. "Someone give Don a hand.&nbsp; Actually, never mind that.&nbsp; Somebody get him a liver."

Sam looked from Robbie to Katelyn then to Zach.&nbsp; Zach was laughing uproariously and for some reason that made her feel better.&nbsp; If there was one person she could count on it was Zach.&nbsp; Good old Zach.&nbsp; She took a relieved breath as he winked at her.

<em>Get back on point</em>, <em>Sam</em>! Sam turned around, looking for Randy.&nbsp; He was seated with the groomsmen.&nbsp; "Everyone let's give a big hand for Randy.&nbsp; That was a great speech.&nbsp; It is going to be very hard to follow."

Randy nodded graciously.&nbsp; "Just one question, though," Sam continued.&nbsp; "Actually for all the groomsmen.&nbsp; You know you're not black, right?"

Randy and the groomsmen smiled self-consciously.&nbsp; Sam turned and gestured at the bridesmaids' table.&nbsp; "I guess they'll all know it, too, by tomorrow."

Laughter, a few catcalls from around the room.&nbsp; "I'm not picky send them over here," yelled someone from the divorcee table.

"Great," Sam said back.&nbsp; "But you should grab Don too before it's only his walk that he can keep straight."

Somehow, Don managed to sink down onto his chair even further.

Sam was actually having fun now.&nbsp; She waved her arms to quiet the crowd.&nbsp; "Okay, okay.&nbsp; That's all the jokes I had written for this.&nbsp; If anything else is funny you know you're too drunk." More laughter.

Sam faced her sister and waited for the room to quiet down a little.&nbsp; "My sister.&nbsp; My sister."&nbsp; She turned back around to the groomsmen's table.&nbsp; "When I knew Katelyn she only had one name.&nbsp; I mean come on, Randy.&nbsp; That is your best shot at a nick name?&nbsp; The same name twice?&nbsp; Where did you even come up with that?"&nbsp; It was like the laughter was a bubbling liquid that filled the room every time Sam spoke.

"I can think of one for you," Randy said.&nbsp; That got some confused, good natured laughter.

Sam smiled.&nbsp; "See and I can't even think of one for you. What about 'dick-face-dick-face." Sam could feel that one went too far for some people--especially her mother. <em>So what?</em>

Sam noticed a waitress dropping off a fresh piece of cake at the table to the left. She snatched it off the plate and took a bite. Some of it smeared on her cheeks. Why hadn't she gotten a slice big enough shaped like a giant axe wedge?

"That's a mouthful," Sam said as she chewed. She looked back over at Randy. "Wow, I bet you don't hear&nbsp;that often from a woman."&nbsp;

"The name," Sam yelled in mock indignation as people laughed.&nbsp; "The name, people." She pointed around Randy. "I meant 'Double Dick Face'. Actually that kind of rolls off the tongue." Sam's mother practically swooned in her chair. Sam's father gave her a harsh gesture to stop.

Sam ignored them both. "Get your mind out of the gutters, people. Speaking of which has anyone seen Don?" Sam didn't think the laughter in the tent could have louder but it did.

Sam turned back to the wedding party's table.&nbsp; "Okay, back to the point.&nbsp; Katie-Kate, has always been there for me."&nbsp; A few snickers.&nbsp; A couple of people smirked at Randy.&nbsp; The room quieted down slightly, feeling the mood shift to something more sedate and personal.

"When I got pregnant I was scared.&nbsp; I bought 77 books on pregnancy. 77.&nbsp; Can you believe that?"&nbsp; Sam began walking around the room, making eye contact here and there like she had done this a million times. "I bet I've thought more about pregnancy than anyone in this room...except maybe the bridesmaids after they wake up tomorrow morning."

Laughter again.&nbsp; A table of unhappy bridesmaids, knives behind those eyes and smiles.&nbsp; <em>I am going to be killed by gang of girls in pink taffeta tomorrow</em>, Sam thought.&nbsp; "I am going to be to be killed by gang of girls in pink taffeta tomorrow," Sam said, echoing her own thoughts before she could stop.

She put her hand to her mouth like she was talking into a radio.&nbsp; "All units, be on the lookout for a gang of slightly drunk bridesmaids in gaudy pink taffeta."

Sam turned back to Katelyn. "Seriously Kate, did you really think dressing them like that would distract people from the fact that you of all people chose to wear white today? That's like me wearing a bikini right now." Sam made air quotes. "Let's all pretend we're still virgins.'"

Sam turned to the "kid's" table. They were wide mouthed with half-shock, half-amusement. "White means you're still a virgin. Sort of like most of the groomsmen right now. Save your money, guys, so you can get out your parents basement some day."

That got a few laughs, but not many.&nbsp; Mostly uncomfortable ones. It was hard to come back from virgin jokes at the bride's expense. "So, all joking aside, Kate has always been there for me.&nbsp; I have always," Sam looked around the crowd of faces seriously, "always been able to count on Kate being behind me in whatever I do."

Sam's parent's nodded though her dad still looked a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; <em>I am never going to hear the end of it on that virgin joke</em>, Sam thought.&nbsp; Not that she could blame him.&nbsp; Katelyn had never been shy around the boys.&nbsp; Sam could count on 2 fingers the number of men she had been with.&nbsp; Katelyn would need both her hands and feet and to borrow the hands of half the groomsmen--maybe she already had. <em>Shoot that would have been a good one</em>! <em>Too late. </em>

Sam gave her dad a small smile.&nbsp; <em>Dad is probably is just glad she managed to get married before</em>--

"My dad is just glad--" Sam slammed her mouth shut so hard it jarred her teeth a little.&nbsp; "My dad is just glad he can finally have a bathroom of his own again." Polite laughter. The jokes were supposed to be over, the audience was a little punch drunk now. Funny or sentimental. Which way was this going. Sam had no clue either.

<em>It is like I have no filter</em>, Sam thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;"So anyways Katelyn has always been right there behind me.&nbsp; When I graduated from college I went to work at a bank.&nbsp; When Kate graduated a few years later she discovered there were things called 'banks'."&nbsp; Sam winked at the room.&nbsp; "She discovered overdraft."&nbsp; Laughter and a few appreciative groans. Going to be jokes again. Maybe Sam would finish sentimental they were thinking. She could read it in their faces.

"So anyways I bought 77 books and there was Kate right behind me buying her one pregnancy book to support me. We--"&nbsp; Sam's eyes met Katelyn's. Katelyn quickly looked away.

"Perfect day..." Sam said to herself.&nbsp; People in the crowd exchanged glances.&nbsp; <em>God chose this day</em>, Sam thought.&nbsp; Or had she said it aloud. Katelyn shifted uncomfortably in her chair.&nbsp; Beside her Robbie sensed the abrupt change in Katelyn's mood from anger to discomfort. He put his hand over hers. At any other time it would have been a warning to Sam but...

Sam. Was. Furious.&nbsp; The level of anger washing over her she had never felt before.&nbsp; It was almost hatred.&nbsp; It came from deep, deep inside her. It was not coming from her baby. It was coming from the <em>her</em> around him. The part of her that did not care about family politics or decorum. The part that was tasked with bringing this baby into the world, health and happy--regardless of who she had to piss off to do it.

<em>Fuck you, Katie-Kate.</em>

Sam had seen a movie once where a bunch of hairy smelly bikers had accidentally wandered into a bar run by the mafia. They had been all bravado and jokes until the scary mafia boss locked the door and said "Now, yous can't leave." All the air had left the room,"the narrator had said<em>. </em>"These were guys who had a reputation for breaking up bars. But they knew they had wandered into the wrong bar.<em>" </em>And then the ass-kicking had started.

That was the feeling in the tent now. The door was locked in the sweltering tent with no walls. No one was getting out of here unscarred.

Because it was...so damn irresponsible of Katelyn.&nbsp; Thoughts half-formed slammed into Sam's brain all at once.&nbsp; <em>You risked...to cover up...you hid me in the back of the tent to...no one could see us together...you lied...</em>

Sam made her decision.&nbsp; She had Zach.&nbsp; She had her son.&nbsp; They were a family.&nbsp; <em>Screw the rest of these selfish drunk bastards.</em>

"Yes, Katie-Kate has always been there behind me.&nbsp; Zach and I got pregnant about 7 months ago.&nbsp; I say 'about' because there was a month there where Zach swore we couldn't trust the pregnancy tests and he wanted to keep trying.&nbsp; I had to start sleeping standing up to keep him off me."

The crowd laughed again, glad to be back in familiar territory.&nbsp; "And again there was Katie-Kate right behind me."&nbsp; Sam turned back to Katelyn.&nbsp; "How far along are you now, Katelyn?"&nbsp; Katelyn should have known the words were coming. Sam could see the terror and also defiance in her eyes. <em>She knows I know. </em>Maybe she thought prim-and-proper Sam would not have the guts to say the words--but Katie-Kate was wrong.<em>&nbsp; I have guts in spades right now</em>, <em>Kate</em>, Sam thought, then laughed at her own pun. It was a high pitched sound, a little crazy.

The room went dead silent.&nbsp; Even the wait staff froze in place.&nbsp; "The heat was dangerous to my baby.&nbsp; You knew that," Sam said, all pretense of humor dropped.&nbsp; "You knew it, Kate.&nbsp; And you could not be what everyone always said you would be--waddling down the aisle 6 months pregnant, not able to fit into your perfect lying white dress.&nbsp; We could not have that, now could we, Kate."&nbsp; Sam could hear people shifting uncomfortably in their seats behind her. She pressed on.

"You risked my..." Sam trailed off as the realization of the entire level of Katelyn's selfishness hit her.&nbsp; "Holy Fuck, Katelyn!&nbsp; The heat would not just--not just my...Holy Fuck, Kate!&nbsp; You fucking selfish bitch!"

Sam needed to be away from the heat and away from Katelyn and away from Don and every other fucking person at--

<em>Enough! </em>Sam looked at Zach. It was time to go.&nbsp; "Zach, come on!&nbsp; Let's..."&nbsp;

Sam saw the look on his face. He was looking at Katelyn. Suddenly, the last piece that had been niggling at her consciousness fell into place as her brain did the math. Robbie came onto the scene just slightly too late to be the father of Katelyn's baby.

"Zach," she whispered.&nbsp; He did not even have the courage to look her in the eyes.&nbsp; <em>All those trips here. You already </em>HAVE <em>a family</em>!

"Had a family," Sam finished aloud. She walked slowly over to the table to pick up her purse.&nbsp; Her eyes were on her on the back of the tent but she could feel every eye in the room on her.&nbsp; At the back table, Ms. Flannigan was still there but the vacant, vapid look was back.

"Lovely," was all she said.&nbsp; Sam picked up her purse, started to shove the speech notes into it then stopped.&nbsp; She tossed the notes on the table.

"The perfect day, Katelyn," Sam said without turning around.&nbsp; "God picked the day, Robbie?" she said acidly. When Sam turned around Katelyn was staring at her hands, crying.&nbsp; The wedding party was over.&nbsp; People were quietly gathering their things.

Sam left the wedding hall, deciding to find the first hotel outside of city limits that had a clean pool and some real air conditioning.&nbsp; She put a hand on her stomach as she walked.&nbsp; The baby kicked but only slightly.

"I know," Sam said to him. "I'm hot, too."

&nbsp;

Ms. Flannigan waited until the tent had cleared it and it was just wait staff working quietly in the background.&nbsp; The old crone stood very carefully and reached carefully for her cane.

"And they say gods have no sense of humor," she said to no one in particular.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The lightning bugs hovered in the warm air pulsating in a slow rhythm. It was one of the strangest phenomena Michael took notice of moving from one place to the next, sometimes things moved like a faucet of time was turned down. No, it was more like some moments are like being in the show and others are like commercials. This bike ride felt purposed, present and full. The smell of a cigar wafting through the summer night air lingered just thickly enough Michael could almost taste it.

Riding to Ellory's house was something Michael had not done in his first childhood. But he was pretty certain he had done it a few times in memories that hadn't washed in fully yet. He had looked up the route on his computer in his dorm but the turns felt natural and he got a feeling of familiarity when he swooped under a low hanging magnolia branch. The past always felt cozier than the present and the green hue of the evening magnified the aura of summer. The sun seemed to be pinned in place just below the treeline and the trees themselves along with the grass seemed to be radiating light.

It usually took some time for Michael to adjust to an earlier self but the bike, as physiologically complex as it seems, moving pedals and balancing while steering on a narrow sidewalk, seemed to help him snap into gear. He turned hard to the left, leaning over one side of the bike, then over to the other side extending his leg to counter balance. The Schwinn bike glided up over hills and down lifting his stomach into his chest, he smiled, he forgot that used to happen.

The errand that he embarked on that night was secret. Michael made sure his parents didn't know he left the house. He had left his bike under a fir tree across the road and prepped his backpack under his bed until he was ready. All errands could be improved with an addition of clandestine behavior and a heaping pile of the excitement of getting away with something.

Today was July 10th, and Michael was determined to remove the infamy of this particular birthday. He intended to replace the memories of muffled yelling and seething words of love turned to hate. Anything would be better than what she had, but Michael thought of an ideal replacement. It was admittedly more recently on Michael's mind than Ellory's but it still seemed cool even if her childlike fascination had subsided.

Michael made the turn onto Ellory's street, oh yeah he had totally ridden this before. He hit the brakes suddenly reminded of his instructions to Ellory. He leened over and put out his kickstand then rifled through his back pack pulling out a black tee-shirt and eyeblack, which may have just been mascara on second inspection. I wonder if Ellory is actually gonna be wearing this stuff too?

Michael bent low sneaking up to the side of Ellory's house to look for her, voices could be heard inside undulating in emotion. Michael peered over the fence looking for Ellory.

"Hiya, looking for me?"

A voice called from behind. Michael turned around but didn't see anything. Ellory stepped out from behind a bush wearing a large black turtle neck and black toboggan with perfectly square eye black under her eyes. They both smiled. Michael put his finger over his mouth then pointed towards the road. Ellory walked back to the bush and picked up her bike.

"Let's ride!" Ellory whispered hunched over, walking her bike to the road.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad plays are a dime a dozen. Ellory had contributed to the pile throughout the years and sometimes in moments of inspiration would produce pages of scripts. Michael wasnât usually good at masking his expressions so when E started talking about the Middletons, an upstart english family of all girls and the subject of most of the plays she wrote Michael had to avoid making funny faces. Elliandor, the oldest daughter of eight girls, is an independent free thinking woman and has a pension for exclaiming âNot Iâ. Ellory often quoted Elliandor, she would put her hand on her forehead and lean against a wall and say âNot Iâ in what resembled some accent.Â  Michael adopted a flat affect while listening to Elloryâs stories. The stone faced approach allowed Michael a few moments to select the emotion he should display, and filter out the others. Michael often felt he should devote more time to slowing time, it too often felt like he was plopped into one place or another in a sprint, like he was a newborn giraffe fleeing lions. The emotional exhaustion is really something to consider when one spends all their waking moments in known important and emotionally consequential times. One hallmark of all the Middleton stories were the proposals, if all currently written plays are considered canon, Elliandor, has been proposed to eleven times, and said yes eight of those times.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo get this, I was thinking about whatâs going to happen with Zechery and Elliandor.â Ellory said reaching for her blue spiral bound notebook. Michael had been somewhere so terribly familiar he had gotten stuck in a wonderfly sticky memory. He was scraping himself free of the never ending moments of his four year old self's happy birthday song sung to him by his grandparents while eyeing a white cream cheese frosting cake.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo Zechary surprises Elliandor on the rooftop and saysâ Ellory said, plunking her ink pen on Michaelâs forehead playfully but still a bit too hard. Michael arrived blinking. âWill you marry me?â Ellory said, penning the question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âYes?â Michael answered without thinking. Ellory held up a finger gesturing to hold as she tried to figure out what happened next. Michael saw the blue notebook, thought about the proposal he had just accepted and he knew exactly the conversation he was in. He made a mental note to prepare in case someone proposed to him unexpectedly, there were too many things he would say yes to if someone asked quickly or he didnât completely hear the question.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âI think Elliandor and Rhoman should get together.â Michael said, bringing up an unwritten story arch. Ellory looked up and stuck her pen in her mouth. Michael thought about the many stories Ellory wrote leading the humble Butlerâs son and Elliandor together. They slowly went from hating each other to âbumping bonnetsâ over so many carriage rides and garden stroll run-ins.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âYeah, that is a little contrived. I just think the Butler and the oldest daughter is a cookie cutter sort of thing. Plus she hates him, and I would have to unwrite all those times she talks about how dumb he is.â Ellory retorted critically of Michaels synopsis of her once favorite future Mr. Elliandor Middleton. Michael, went a bit cross eyed considering the chunk of memories he had of listening blankly to âthe three weddingsâ a story in which Elliandor and Rhoman were married three separate times due to something about leap year and tradition. Those were some of my favorites he thought. A novel worth âyes maddamsâ and âwait there is something I have to tell youâs was just severed like an iceberg from a glacier floating around in Michaels mind until it would slowly melt away.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âHe proposes and guess what she says?â Ellory said eyes beaming. Michael nervously knocked down real options in his head, forgetting he could just say âwhatâ. He would be damned if he clumsily suggested away something as important as the saga of Mr. Suttons marriage to young naive Ennia or Dotty the cooks learning to dance again after a brief but heart wrenching paralysis.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âShe said â¦ nothing?â Michael said anxiously at first but then confident on second inspection, Elliandor was not the type to say nothing, especially when proposed to.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âNo, she saysâ Ellory moved into position pressing herself against the wall. âNot Iâ</span>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can't remember how much I said to you at DZ the other day so some of this might be a rehash of that. That time is not linear concept has continued to bounce around in my mind since we talked. I saw a story recently that said time travel would be fine (at least mathematically) because Time always forced its way back to the path it had taken before the time traveler arrived. Maybe not the exact moment by moment decision sequence but the high points always default to the accepted "canon" timeline.

But what if time was not linear. You do A, B, C and D, because you will do E and F. You can try to change C a thousand different ways but it is stuck because E will be done. So Time cannot necessarily be unraveled and rewoven how we want it. Sort of like instead of Time being a river it is a pond we are all throwing rocks in. I throw in one and it starts the first ripple. That ripple hits the side of the pond and comes back right as I throw my second stone. That stone lands on a crest of the return ripple no matter how many times I throw it or from what angle. It gets even more locked as you throw in your stones because now my ripples and stones have to match certain patterns because otherwise your patterns would not make sense. If I somehow screwed up your ripple with my third stone then maybe your third stone--which should hit a crest of one of your outgoing ripples doesn't have crest there to hit. Now Time and Physics are out of sync and someone has to win. Your third stone cannot hit what isn't there but there are other future actions expecting that stone to hit what SHOULD be there (the crest of your ripple). So Time and Physics makes a deal--if it should be there then it is even if it means Physics and Time have to do some on-the-fly adjusting of the pond.

In the context of Ellory, that brings up two interesting points. One--as you touch on in this post--Michael is always coming in during the peaks and valleys of his life. Our long-term memory selects the important memories to keep and tries to stitch them together into some sort of a cohesive story. But if you lived in those I suppose it would be like living in a soap opera--100% drama all the time. So maybe Michael is hamstringed because his long term memory threw out the mundane moments (unless they were so epically mundane they forced their way into the long term memory--"The Most Boring Hour of My Life.")

And maybe that is where Time and Physics cheat. They know the Time Traveler can only hit their big memories and events in their lives from their long term memory. So Time can manipulate all of the mundane, lost-to-memory moments that the Time Traveler cannot get to. Time just has to extend the coffee break of the maintenance worker who is supposed to check the timing on the stoplight that Ellory is killed at by a second. That second puts the decision of "cut out early" or "hit the last job for the day" into the former because just like $19.99 is light years away from $20.00 on infomercials, 4:29:59 PM is light years away from 4:30:00 PM. 4:29 PM...you've got 30 minutes, you can make it to the last job of the day. But by 4:30 PM traffic will probably be terrible, the light will still be there tomorrow, I'll hit it first thing in the morning...no one's going to die if I don't get to that traffic light check today. Then the maintenance worker loses that second somewhere: car takes an extra second to move, Time shaves incremental tenths of seconds off of the drive so that the maintenance worker gets realigned to his own timeline. That is probably what deja vu is: we have done XX before which is why it is so familiar we are just a second earlier or later than we are "supposed" to be doing XX.

So like we talked about probably some good comedic stuff available in Michael trying once or twice to slow down time to get a moment to deal with the disorientation. Flirting with the waitress is always a great device. Just takes him staring deeply into the waitress's eyes way too long while she is trying to take his and Ellory's order. Or opposite device (if you want to throw in some ASMC) In the real/original timeline he looked up at the waitress, asked for a milk, two straws (an inside joke between him and Ellory) and turned back to Ellory. But Time doesn't like people peeing in its pond, screwing up the ripples, so maybe it kicks him once or twice to send a message.

<span style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">Michael has put his reactions on slow-mo speed which is a new tactic he developed. But Time Traveler Michael gets distracted as Past Michael is raising his eyes up to meet the waitress's. Because TT Michael controls Past Michael, Past's eyes stop right at the waitress's breasts and stay there while he (time traveler Michael) is mentally sorting out the upcoming conversation with Ellory, his goals, objectives, etc. And then Past Michael orders a milk and adds "with two straws" and leaves his eyes stuck on the waitress's breasts until she walks away in disgust. TT Michael finally notices and says "Damn!". But it comes out like Past Michael is now watching the waitress's ass while she walks away and saying "Daaaammmmnnnn!"  TT Michael knows what is coming next but can't stop it because it is locked into the timeline: the next sequence ALWAYS in Past Michael and Ellory's inside joke is that he says to Ellory (accompanied by a wink and a faux leer): "One of those straws is for you."</span>

Ellory is totally shocked.  Maybe they have the exact same conversation they did in the original timeline/past but now it takes on a completely different tone (even though it is the exact same words used by both of them).  

If you really want Time to send a shot across the bow you can really play with it and have the entire conversation happening and TT Michael is trapped and can't say anything, only watch in horror as the conversation takes on totally new undertones.  Or maybe he figures out halfway through the conversation that he can shape the way Past Michael says something so he is scrambling to remember how the mundane conversation went.  This being the conversation where Past Michael tried to convince Ellory to "do something totally crazy with him".  Of course, in the original timeline it was go with him to his favorite spot on the beach to watch the sunrise or something like that.  Past Michael has "a blanket in his car".  He is "prepared."  Girls like to make flirty jokes at guys when guys are trying to be serious.  But the conversation "what's the blanket for?", "oh you'll see" is a lot different between a man and a woman after the man has totally horndogged out on the waitress.  

"So this 'amazing experience' you are trying to sell me on.  You've done it before?"  

"Mostly by myself.  Once in a group that was there when I showed up.    But..oh, hey, I am totally okay if you want to bring someone else with us.  I'm happy to have them, too."

"And it's safe?"

"100%.  Well, I guess, once I passed out and woke up totally wet from the waist down.  But that's a small price to pay for what it does to your consciousness.  I promise you will be totally opened up and relaxed."

"How long does it take?"

"Couple of hours max.  Though after a while the sand can get uncomfortable.  I started keeping a blanket in the car after that 'wet pants' incident.  I can put that under us."

"Okay, I'll go against my better judgement here and do this."

"Great!  Let me get the waitress."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Micheal stared blankly at the wall in front of him considering the moments he wasted. The fortress of surity that he could smooth over thousands missteps gone. He sat back in his chair, slowly exhaling realizing he had held his breath for a long time.

What would Ellory do? Micheal thought wishing he could ask her. "Oh hey Ellory quick question what do you do when you discover, due to the physical laws of the universe I can't see you anymore?" Michael simulated the conversation. Her middle school self might give him something like.

"People leave, and you should atleast let them know you aren't leaving because of them." She would say twirling her hoodie draw strings.
"But I am not leaving, I will still be here El, just in a different sort of way because of hedonic attenuation to sentimental vibrations." Michael paused, looking up in his imaginary conversation. That sounded like something Zeb would say, he would totally blame science for some failed relationship. Ever since he saw Zeb kick a perfect stranger in the back of the head because he wanted to see if he could lift his leg that high, Michael had vowed to never follow any impulse he could be sure Zeb would share.
"I don't want to, but it isn't my choice, and I wish it where my choice." Michael said looking at the pie faced Ellory slowly twirling the strings and looking confused and misty eyed. Maybe I could talk to her senior year. "It's always your choice, and no matter what I will always be your friend." Ellory said swallowing hard.
"No no, it isn't like that, it's not that I don't like like you it's that I figured out I can't visit anymore because of atte..." What would Zeb not say "math, I guess"
"If you need help I can tutor you?" She would say hopefully lifting slightly off her toes to punctuate her offer. Michael swallowed hard sitting in his dorm. It appeared to him in that moment the age that might be best suited to this far fetched and magical conundrum might be six or seven year old Ellory. He smiled and started thinking about an anchor. The only trouble with this would be he can't always get to her, Mark and Judy could not be reliably convinced to driver little Michael over to see his friend, even when he told them it was urgent. Michael wanted little Ellory's answer, it was the only one he couldn't simulate, he could never tell what she would say. He thought about the time two of them drank pickle juice, Ellory figured she liked pickles and juice so why not? "Ok this one's yours" she said handing Michael a massive plastic virginia state cup filled halfway with cold pickle juice. He thought about tapping out and letting his younger self enjoy this delicacy but he was curious. Ellory grabbed the pickle jar with both hands lifted it to her mouth and took two large swallows. She puckered her lips and squinted hard. Michael looked on as she smacked her lips, her cheeks flushed and eyes watered. "It tastes like saying goodbye to a frog." She said blinking. I don't think I want a sensible answer to this situation Michael thought.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The smells of sweat and stale refrigeron blasted Callie as the door to the Pit slid open.&nbsp; Even through her mask it was a disgusting combination, each competing to make her retch.&nbsp; But it was understandable.&nbsp; Ranklers were not drawn from the silk masks of society.&nbsp; Most of them were barely a step beyond neanderthals.&nbsp; And the Pit was not where you took a first date--unless you never wanted to see them again (alive or dead).

A few ranklers she knew made eye contact and gave a quick nod before looking away.&nbsp; Callie nodded to them as she passed, looking for an open and relatively clean cube to bid from.&nbsp; After 5 years, she had yet to get over the claustrophobic feeling in the Pit.&nbsp; Everyone was packed in like sardines, barely two feet between them.&nbsp; It made her skin crawl at the sight of so many bodies practically piled onto each other.

Callie managed to snag a cube a few rows back from the podium.&nbsp; She tapped a finger over the cube's interface jack, letting her gloves autoclave it clean.&nbsp; It was not uncommon to see some rankler shoving a Q-Tip into a jack in a vain attempt to clean it.&nbsp; Why bother, Callie always thought.&nbsp; She had paid up for her retractable gloves, getting all the bells an whistles like Jack Cleaner.&nbsp; It had turned out to be a prudent choice.

"Callista-san," a raspy voice croaked to her left.&nbsp; A large man in a trench coat two cubes down raised a worn, dirty gloved hand in greeting and waved. Or at least he tried to wave. Miles, or Little Miles as he was called, was so big he could barely fit into the plexiglass cubical. His wave looked like he was trying to scrub the side of the plexiglass clean.

"Miles-san," Callie scowled trying to ignore his impolite gesture.&nbsp; <em>Why not just to grab me with your meathooks</em>? Callie thought.

She tapped the left side of her mask with her first and third fingers.

Little Miles obviously saw her gesture but ignored it. The old timers had no manners. "Heard you had some action on the way in," he said. "A Blue Piller."

Callie nodded. She scanned the auditorium stage. No one at the podium yet to save her from Miles' dry banter. She sighed and turned her eyes back to him.

"Jumped out in front of the guy in front of me."

Little Miles raised an eyebrow then swiped three fingers diagonally down his broad chest. <em>A suicide</em>?

Callie shrugged. "Maybe. He was at least a red pillar." Callie thought for a moment, trying to remember the dead man's face. "Maybe blue pillar."

Miles' eyes crinkled slightly in what appeared to be a wry smile behind his mask. Callie sighed. The old timers were all like that. Hard to read. Often forgetting to use proper hand language. Always seeming to be laughing at jokes only they understood.

Little Miles nodded and turned back towards the podium. The conversation was apparently over.

"I saw his face. His whole face," Callie said suddenly. She was not sure why she had said it.

Little Miles slowly turned his eyes back to her. "He was a Maskless?" There was no amusement in his eyes now.

Callie shook her head. Little Miles pried his massive girth out of his cube. She could almost hear the cube sigh as it retracted its plexiglass walls back to standard width. Miles reached into the cube beside her and grabbed its occupant by the collar and pulled him out. The man spluttered in anger then quickly disappeared into the crowd once his eyes reached the top of Little Miles' head.

Miles shoved himself into the cube. He leaned close. "Tell me exactly what happened."

"The guy jumped out in front of a car in front of me. Didn't look like a suicide; just bad timing judgement. I got out to help--"

"Did you touch him?" Little Miles asked. He eyes were piercing. Callie had never been this close to Little Miles. Most people kept the minimum 6 feet plus a little extra "to be polite". Now he looked like a 'Roid head stuffed into a priest's confessional.

Callie started to gesture 'no' then stopped. "Yes, actually. He..."

Little Miles' face pressed into the plexiglass, bowing it inward slightly toward her. "He what?"

"He asked me to take it off," Callie said. She waited for the revulsion to register in Little Miles' eyes. It did not. Instead then peered hard at her then looked away thoughtfully.

"I see."

Callie waited for him to say more. Miles shifted his bulk back towards the podium. Callie turned her attention back to it as well.

"Where was this accident?" Little Miles asked after a few minutes.

Callie told him the cross streets to give him a general idea. It was outside the Sprawl but just barely. Little Miles nodded.

"Did you detox your hands before you came in? Salas won't be happy if she hears--"

"She did." Derrick said, coming up behind her. She jumped. How did he do that? Come up behind her so silently. Little Miles had jumped, too, which made her feel slightly better.

"I made her detox them twice before I got back in the car with her. Face, too. And cycle a fresh mask."

Little Miles looked between her and Derrick. "I see." He turned slightly so that he could see Callie. "Wait here," he said then pried himself out of the cube and walked off down the aisle way. People cleared for him like ice from an ice breaker ship.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">Calowyn stared at her hands.&nbsp; Over and over she enveloped them and then retracted her gloves.&nbsp; Her hands had long since been sanitized.&nbsp; Or most of them had.&nbsp; She still held her retractable mask nodes balanced on the tips of her index fingers so the gloves could not quite make it completely over them.</p>
<em>I touched his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

Extend, flip the nodes to the next fingers, balance the nodes, retract, rebalance the nodes, extend...&nbsp; There was no reason for it.&nbsp; The two mask nodes too had been relinked for a while now.&nbsp; She did not look down at her fingers.&nbsp; Instead in her mind's eye she stared into the dying man's eyes looking up into hers.&nbsp; There was no fear in them, no peace, nothing profound on the tip of his tongue.&nbsp; His expression was blank.&nbsp; If eyes were the window to the soul then his had checked out long before his body.&nbsp; Calowyn had wondered for years what the eyes of the dead looked like right before they went.

"What a let down," she mumbled.

"Callie," said Jakub from behind her, awkwardly.&nbsp; Calowyn sighed then reattached her mask nodes behind her ears.&nbsp; The mask immediately flowed forward, covering her face.&nbsp; It was just far enough away from her skin to make it <em>almost </em>imperceptible but close enough to provide the subconscious security of the knowledge it was there, protecting her from the world.

"Are you..." Jakub said.&nbsp; What did they use to say in the Old Days?

"Yes, I'm decent," she responded, smiling.

"What?" he said, confused.&nbsp; She could almost hear his virtual assistant trying to use the available definitions of the word to provide some sort of context.

"'Decent'.&nbsp; It means I am wearing clothes or in this case a mask."

"Oh," he laughed, still slightly uncomfortable.&nbsp; "Oldspeak."&nbsp; And like that the spell was broken, danger averted, the beast in the bushes was gone.&nbsp; He came and sat beside her on the hood of their car.&nbsp; He put out a gloved hand.&nbsp; For a moment, she thought he was offering her his hand then she noticed the thickness of his gloves.&nbsp; Her eyes darted towards the containment van.&nbsp; The EVAC team was working the corpse over and the sanitizing the ground around him.

"No, not him," Jakub said.&nbsp; "He's still getting processed.&nbsp; This one's..." he held out his palm.&nbsp; His glove displayed a small hologram.&nbsp; "Oh, across town.&nbsp; Way across."

Calowyn could see the tip of a small brown boot sticking out of the EVAC's body bag.&nbsp; "Sloppy," she muttered.&nbsp; Jakub followed her gaze then jumped up and stormed over to the EVAC unit.&nbsp; He pointed at the protruding boot while conveying his less than stellar assessment of the team's techniques and...yes, also their parentage.&nbsp; One of the EVAC techs quickly knelt down to fully close the body bag while his partner stood chagrined in the face Jakub's barrage.&nbsp; Calowyn smiled. <em>So, so young</em>, she thought.

She stood and stretched.&nbsp; The sun had broken through the low hanging clouds and the day was heating up.&nbsp; "Jakub," she subvocalized into her mask.&nbsp; He stopped his harangue long enough look back her way.&nbsp; Thick red Warrant gloves flowed over her hands and she gestured him over.&nbsp; The red was unmistakable from that distance and he blanched.&nbsp; Immediately, he spun on his heel and began to jog back to the car.&nbsp; The standing EVAC tech's shoulders sagged slightly inside his hazmat suit as he noticed Calowyn's Warrant gloves.&nbsp; He knelt down quickly by the body bag and found something very interesting on the ground that needed his full attention.&nbsp; Satisfied, she turned to Jakub who was now waiting patiently at attention 6 feet to her left.

"Kronas," he said formally.&nbsp; Then his tone faltered.&nbsp; "Callie, I was just--"&nbsp; Calowyn stared hard into his eyes until his voice trailed off.&nbsp; The presence of the gloves were a hard rebuke.&nbsp; "Kronas, I apologize for my temerity."&nbsp; Calowyn let the words hang between them as she compartmentalized his beautiful face into a little box in her mind.

"You have a strong interest in the goings-on of EVAC teams.&nbsp; Perhaps you should return there," she said softly.

Emotions flowed over Jakub's terrified, but still exquisitely beautiful face.&nbsp; Years of hard work, years of clawing his way up, were dangling in the wind.&nbsp; From a little imaginary string tied to her blood-red Warrant gloves.&nbsp; Transfer back to the EVAC teams would be starting all over again, only now with the known disapproval of a Warrant officer.&nbsp; A Watch-Warrant officer actually, Calowyn reminded herself.&nbsp; She needed to be careful.&nbsp; She could see by the slight shudders of his mask that Jakub's breathing was growing slightly more frantic.

"Please, Calowyn," he whispered.&nbsp; "Please don't."

<em>I need to start working with uglier boys,</em> Calowyn thought sourly.

"Never forget again," she whispered, but her voice hissed with all the venom she could muster.&nbsp; It was a considerable amount.&nbsp; Warrants did not make Watch by anything except by a cold, ruthless and single minded dedication to duty.&nbsp; Sometimes as a distraction or even an experiment she played at being a friend or lover or both; but once the game or experiment was over... "Now, go play with the techs."

She had been about to add that he could get a ride back with the EVAC crew and she would have him reassigned to a junior Warrant.&nbsp; It would sting and be a loss of face and a roadblock in his career path--but not an insurmountable one.&nbsp; But he spoken before she could finish.

"I saw you.&nbsp; You took your mask off.&nbsp; Everyone saw you," he said hotly.&nbsp; The little box where had carefully place her memory of his beautiful face slammed shut.

Calowyn's head cocked slightly to the side and she regarded him the way you would a bug you were about to smash.&nbsp; Jakub's face fell before the words left his mouth.&nbsp; She stepped closer and reached up and gently grabbed his chin between her gloved thumb and forefinger.&nbsp; She slowly turned his head from side to side so that he could see the crowd of people milling around watching the two of them out of the corners of their eyes.

"Do you want to ask any of them what they saw?&nbsp; Because I can tell you.&nbsp; They saw what you did," she said.&nbsp; Her voice was no longer a whisper but it was still quiet.&nbsp; "They saw nothing."&nbsp; She turned his face back so that they were looking each other in the eye.&nbsp; Their masks were almost touching.&nbsp; "And you saw..."

"Nothing," he said softly.

"You saw an old man get hit by a car," Calowyn said as she released his chin.&nbsp; "You saw me talk to the old man--"

"Pre-," Jakub interrupted then immediately looked away.

Calowyn scowled.&nbsp; "You went to call in the EVACs.&nbsp; When you returned the old...the Pre--like some Pre's do--had taken off his mask before he died."&nbsp; Jakub was staring at the ground, fully aware of how much between them had been just a game or some sort of fantasy conjured in his mind.&nbsp; "You saw me maintain standard protocol the entire time."

Jakub nodded.&nbsp; He looked so dejected that Calowyn almost relented.&nbsp; Almost.

"Now, go play tech," she said and shooed him away with a condescending fluttering of her fingers.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am always amazed at how I am transported by your writing. Without describing the world Callowyn occupies I can see the street the futuristic cars and the post apocalyptical near world these people occupy. I think your dialogue cuts through this fascinating world compelling the reader to hold fast to the unfolding story with the sense that if only they had time they could look all around and take in this detailed world. 

Callowyn is powerful, metacognitive and acutely aware of her position. In her interaction with Jakub, she sets the tone by immediately distancing herself and in doing so communicating the dynamic between the two. She lets him be afraid and fumble about worried about his actions, then she assures him he is right to worry. I like this manipulative person on the page, in real life I would not like to cross this person. This character is so aware of the dialogue and you capture her manipulative nature so well forcing Jakub to look around. I could feel the space between them and the sound of thick rubber gloved touching where they shouldn't. 

But there is a clear dichotomy of all this posturing. Callowyn is in danger, she lives in a high context society bound by strict and severe rules and she violated one of them. This is a cunning animal putting up a defense, waiting, breathing heavy to see if there is enough muscle to ward of predators circling. I think introducing so new words that aren't yet known kind of adds to the out on a limb vibe. I don't know what a "Pre" is but it makes me feel like I am in a strangers house. So the vibe of Callowyn shutting out Jakub really goes well with the uncertainty of all these hazmat suites and talk of containment. 

I am curious about what happened in this world. I get the general sense of the aftermath of a pandemic, with the strict offices around cleanup. I am curious how the pandemic changed this world. 

The foreshadowing feels like the intro to a tragedy, a strong, intelligent person has just acted outside societies bounds and now the person who usually plans and calculates is reacting. I don't know how ominous the interacting is meant to be but it certainly feels deeply ominous. I like Callowyn, and I look forward to seeing her more often!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Expectation is the scent of reality. Michael wouldn't say aloud that he was often hesitant to hope when theÂ  opportunity arose, but he was. Ever since he could write he would write to santa and ask for presents, he would even underline and bold the important ones. As soon as the envelope went to the mailbox he would immediately start worrying about whether or not santa would get it.

"Do you think he loses letters?" Michael asked his mother.

"I don't think he does, it's the magic and he has elves that got through them." Judy responded while gently setting a gaudy fake house on some white fluff with little flecks of clear plastic on it. Michael was relieved for a moment, but only a moment.

"Who picks up the letters from here?" Michael posited with a renewed concern.

"The post office will take it and then hand it straight to the elves who hand it straight to santa. Would you hand me that pig?" Judy said pointing to a tiny pig wrapped in brown paper. Michael watched as judy placed the small ceramic pig on a outfrount of one of the gaudy little houses with a mirror that was supposed to look like ice. The pig sat on its haunches and snapped into position at a particular place. Judy flipped a switch and it started to rotate and glide across the small mirror. Michael almost forgot to worry about his letter.

"Do the mailman ice skate it to the eleves?" Michael said recalling his experience ice skating and how difficult he found it to stay upright. Judy thought for a moment while spreading the fluff around some little fake trees.

"No, the post office, and the elves use magic, and the letters go into a special tube that goes straight into santas workshop. Like at the bank. " Michael nodded. Then walked to the living room and reached into the couch cushion and pulled a small piece of paper. He had written a backup list, in case he needed to send another. He then starred at the squiggles but wasn't quite sure what number five on the list was, Judy had told him it was a bit like prayer you didn't have to know it all just get close, but santa needed the list and god could read your mind. Michael now had an airtight case and he knew exactly how the letters got to santa but he couldn't help but worry about the letter getting to santa.

Another especially hard thing Michael had to deal with was the wonton selection of Christmas cookies, Judy preferred to try new recipes out of her magazines. She loved the pictures and thought the smiling chefs and celebrities couldnât possibly cook better than her, though they often could. Michael hated peppermint and cinnamon, but sometimes the recipe called for it. But upon cleaning his bathroom and drawing a particularly precious picture Michael was able to convince his mother to bake regular sensible cookies. He watched her stir in the ingredients, not looking away for a moment.

âWhatâs that?â Michael asked as Judy scooped some unknown powder into a little plastic spoon.

âbaking powderâ Judy said peering at the recipe then looking at her watch. Michael nodded permissively.

âWhatâs that?â Michael asked as Judy unscrewed a black bottle.

âVanilla extractâ Judy said hurriedly. Michael nodded permissively.

Judy scooped out the little balls of dough onto a cooking sheet and placed them into the oven then hurried off. Michal watched for a moment through the small window in the oven. He then sat down on the floor and waited for the cookies to be done. He sniffed the air, proper cookies he thought. Judy rushed back in and placed the cookies on the stove to cool then scampered off. Michael paced the floor in between burning his fingers. Finally it hurt just the right amount and he quickly took a big bit of cookie. Michael savored the chocolate and the gooey bits in between opening his mouth to cool his tongue. He swallowed and smacked his lips. âahhhhâ he said aloud. Then he smacked again, there was some unwelcome flavor lingering, at first masked by chocolate and heat, but there it was. Peppermint, the flavor of poison if it was maid by elves. Michael threw the hot gooey cookie mess as hard as he could and it stuck to the ceiling. He had to stay in his room the rest of the day, partly because he was so mad and partly because Judy told him so. The worst part is everyone else liked the chocolate chip cookies with mint and they became a regular Christmas staple, the only consistent Christmas cookie.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok i am going to ask you to explain that opening statement: scent?  

Also before I forget...this came to me tonight.

Ellory: Do you think the date of our death is pre-determined?

Michael: (Distracted with something else they are doing...fixing a sink maybe?  Installing a garbage disposal?)  Yeah.

Ellory:  Yeah?  Yeah?

Michael: What?  Oh, yeah, it's pre-determined.  I mean I guess.

Ellory: "Yeah".  Single word answer from the man who can and DOES debate choices of taco sauce.

Michael: Well, medium is hot, but not too hot, while mild--

Ellory: That is my point.   One of the top three biggest questions of human existence and you have complete surety on the answer.

&lt;....&gt;

So that popped into my head and wanted to put it out there.

------

On Christmas Cookies:

<span style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">Lot of good character development for Michael there but woven in through the entertainment so it is not noticeable. </span>
<span style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">    </span>
I love the idea that Michael wants the right cookies to be made because he knows Santa is going to get one and that may affect the entire gift giving outcome.  Crappy cookies this year might mean crappy presents next year.  Think of that horrible dichotomy.  If Santa hated the cookies and you were hosed for the upcoming Christmas why bother being good?  On the other hand, if Santa liked the cookies you were starting off the year with maybe a little boost to cover a transgression or two (or three).  So Michael knows the cookies are important and you can see if by the way he obsesses over his list and the cookie production the same way.  Sort of ties in with that Ellory/Michael predetermined death idea/conversation.

How does a kid know what Santa likes?  A kid's litmus test has to be his own taste buds and the peppermint is a very bad sign.   I also like that those hated peppermint cookies become the house standard Christmas cookie.  Even if you don't explore it in the story it is a great mental origami to play with for the reader.  If next year is a bad Christmas for Michael as far as gifts go it only proves his theory.  On the other hand, if makes out great at next Christmas then how does he reconcile what has always guided his understanding of Unseen forces?  My experience to this point in my life, how I perceive those experiences and how I want the world to work dictate that X must be the outcome I will get if A,B, and C happen.  Then when X doesn't happen how do I (or Michael in this case) reconcile that.  

Maybe the peppermint cookies can come in somehow does the line.  An old nemesis or something :)

Glad you're writing again.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Calowyn relaxed into the plush seat of the car as it backed out of the death scene and headed up the road.Â  Within a few seconds the vid blinked an incoming call.Â  Calowyn waved it through.

"Calowyn," Dal, her supervisor said, as a greeting.Â  He was working as he spoke and did not look up.

"Dal."

"Are you alone?" he asked.Â  He knew she was. Jakub's personal trackers and individual equipment trackers would show him still at the scene, processing it with the techs.Â  But the old protocols died hard.

She nodded.Â  Had she said 'yes' he would have assumed she was not but under duress or for some reason wanted to spread misinformation.Â  They did that sometimes with the media--intentionally killed a story by letting things "slip".

"You cut Jakub loose?" Dal asked.Â  "Permanently?"

"Yes," Calowyn said.

"How did he do?"

"Excellent," Calowyn replied.Â  She stared at the scenery as the car passed it:Â  buildings, people going about their business, a few stray dogs scrounging for scraps.Â  "He's ready.Â  I pushed him down to Tech level but I would recommend pulling him back with a 'Calowyn made a serious judgement error' in a month, maybe two."

On screen, Dal looked up from from his monitor and over at the vid's camera.Â  He raised an eyebrow.Â  "Two months?Â  Interesting.Â  That may be a record."Â  Dal flipped through something on his monitor.Â  "83 days," he said.Â  It was her record.Â  "That would give Jakub a pretty big head when he finds out.Â  Assuming he ever clears up that far."

"He will," Calowyn said.Â  "Make it 100 days then.Â  I only busted him down to Tech.Â  Good kid."

"Great," Dal said absently, returning his attention to his monitor.Â  He had already dismissed the Jakub from his mind.Â  "Sending you a clean that came in yesterday.Â  Tech is tied up--probably at your scene you just left actually--so you will have to babysit the body for a while."

Calowyn scowled and wrinkled her nose.Â  "Yesterday?Â  It is going to be good and ripe by now."

Dal smirked.Â  "No rest for the wicked or the weary."Â  He cut the connection.

The car had come to a stop to make a turn.Â  On the street corner a woman was selling oranges in giant bags.Â  At few even even looked edible, only slightly rotten.Â  Calowyn rolled down the window and the woman hobbled over, favoring her right leg.

"You want," the woman said.Â  It was a question and a statement.Â  Calowyn reach out and held up her palm.Â  The woman did the same, completing the cash transfer.Â  The car opened its de-com port and the woman placed the oranges in it and walked away to get another bag to sell.Â  As the car turned, the de-com port closed and whirred, scanning and killing any parasites, viruses or other nasties that might have tried to hitchhike along for the ride.Â  The car sped up to match the surround flow of traffic and merged lanes.

Calowyn pulled up the address and stats on her case.Â  "You can control three things," Dal had told her after she had suffered through her 83 days of exile to lowest level of the department.Â  "Your preparation, your effort, and your attitude."Â  Having been unexpectedly raised back up to the team Calowyn had gushed and swore to uphold those tenants.Â  She had been always successful on the first two and mostly successful on the third.Â  Though maybe less successful lately.Â Â <em>I need a vacation,</em> she thought.

She pulled up the case and skimmed through it.Â  The (hopefully) recently dead man was middle aged, no significant health issues, no sketchy political affiliations.Â  A model citizen.Â  Maybe an accident or just bad luck.Â  The address was in one of the suburbs, home prices in the area reasonable, buy-to-sell ratio stable.Â  Crime statistics at tolerable levels.Â  And so on.Â  Calowyn pulled up his social medium and other public photos and flipped through them.Â  He was in good shape, probably a college or high school athlete, active, a lot of foreign trips to exotic beaches it looked like.Â  He had kind eyes.Â  Calowyn liked that.Â  There was--

Calowyn stopped flipping through the images.Â  She flipped back until she found the one she was looking for.Â  It was an unmasked one, the man was with who she assumed to be family and/or close friends from his Pod.Â  She zoomed in on his face and took it to 3D.Â  Calowyn reached out and slowly rotated the virtual representation of the man's head and face from left to right.Â  She recognized the face.Â  Not the man's face specifically, but some of the features.

She called Dal.Â  "The case.Â  He is related to the Pre- at the scene I just left?"

Dal looked over immediately.Â  "Your scene was a Pre-Pandemic?"

"Are the two related?" Calowyn asked again.Â  Dal stared at her for a moment, seemingly dumbfounded.Â  Then he turned quickly back to his monitor and touched it a few times.Â  "I do not know, Cal."Â  He sucked at his teeth as he worked.Â  "Your scene's vic has not loaded yet.Â  Techs must be still processing."

"Seems a little too coincidental if they are related," Calowyn said with a sinking feeling.

Dal nodded.Â  "It does."Â  He turned back to the vid screen.Â  "You want me to give it to someone else?"

Calowyn nodded.Â  Dal touched his monitor.Â  Then touched it again.Â  He leaned forward and read something on the screen then sat back.Â  "Well," was all he said.

"Well?" Calowyn prompted.

"Supervisor override is disabled.Â  Someone either wants you specifically on this or at least--assuming, yes the scene got loaded by Tech just now and the two cases linked immediately.Â  They want you or at least the same investigator,."Â  Dal said.Â  He touched his screen, typing.Â  "It...it may not be specific to you..."Â  He smiled.Â  "Ah, yes, you are in the clear, Cal.Â  I can swap you out but you need to file a statement on the scene case for the replacement investigator."

Calowyn nodded immediately.Â  She was relieved that she had not been stuck on this one specifically, only through bad luck in the rotation.Â  "Kill it," she said.Â  She yawned.Â  "I need a drink."

"Hmmmm, interesting," Dal said, reading his screen.Â  "You are not unlinked from Jakub yet.Â  That is why you jumped in the rotation.Â  Someone wants him on both cases."Â  Dal smiled wickedly.Â  "At Full Investigator no less."

Calowyn practically squawked.Â  "Full--"

Dal's smile shifted to a smirk.Â  "One day.Â  Actually, barely an hour.Â  That kills your 83 days to Full Investigator with room to spare."Â  Dal was enjoying this immensely.Â  "Sorry, Callie.Â  You just lost the record."

"That--that--" Calowyn could not believe her ears.Â  Professional pride aside (well, mostly aside) it was...odd.

"Leave my name on it," she said suddenly.

"What?" Dal asked.Â  "You want--"

"Leave me on.Â  As Head Investigator."

Dal stared at her dumbfounded.Â  "Are you sure?"

"Send the address to me," Calowyn said then disconnected.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Man that pace was great. The substance as well, but what struck me was the pace, concern and urgency lingering in the background while she bought oranges then surfacing. If the next section was the next chapter I would be jumping straight to it! The conspiracy forming heightens the feeling of danger in this pandemic world. I also like that this Jakub guy is somewhat of a "will they won't they", two persons smashed together in intrigue by mysterious forces. And even if they won't or don't it adds another layer to the unfolding events.

So my favorite bits that make me feel like I am in the future car with the smell of rubber and disinfectant is the, 'waved it through' and 'the car opened the de-com port' even the bits about stray dogs and the hobbling woman makes me feel present. All of that really heightens the feelings of events. I like how Dal is having an ordinary day not even looking up to talk about assignments. To him it is just Tuesday, again making it feel like it could be happening. This agency as well is fascinating, it sounds like part cop part mortician part clean up crew. Calowyn has elements of a Sue Grafton detective, the internal monologue and tried and true worn down seen too much individual with a pension for self medicating. She also has a hard nosed attitude with pride, and wit which I think everyone enjoys in heroes/antiheroes.

Also the slang builds and speaks to this worlds history without in depth descriptions, which is nice because there is a lot of inference so it kept me engaged. Things like "Pre", "Tech", "Social Medium", "Pod" make me wonder and construct those uncertain things for myself. I can feel the worlds damage and I think that Calowyn is right on the edge of it. I really like this story and I can feel it evolving, becoming more itself with each iteration.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn shrimped her way out from under the Executorâs limp form.  Like an inch worm she pushed, shoved and slid until she was free enough to let him fall completely to the ground beside her.  Her entire front was slick in the manâs blood.  She was too tired to wipe it away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of habit she rifled the manâs pockets.  An Old World keycard was in one.  A few clips for his pistol in the other.  Various knives and other assorted goodies that Calowyn stayed carefully away from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This one seems like the type to want to take someone with him on the way down</em>, she thought.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was blood on her hands and she slipped slightly as she came down.  For a moment Calowyn just stared at the destruction around her.  So much.  Too much.  She spotted the cylindrical time capsule.  In the fight it must have gotten kicked around the room.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sudden, irrational desire to see what was in that capsule hit her.  Why did so many have to die to stop this thing from coming?  What could Old Earth have cooked up for her colonies that had scared the higher ups?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn hesitated then climbed over the Executorâs back.  Even now some distant part of her calculated and inform her of the deceased approximate time of death: 2-25 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No kidding, Sherlock</em>, Calowyn thought.  <em>We were there.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We did it, said another voice.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn drug herself forward until she was alongside it.  In the pale flashing emergency lights it looks somehow sinister.  What was she going to unleash?  Sickness, disease, a time bomb? That would be just her luck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn triggered her mask and gloves automatically.  Then she placed a hand on the operation panel cover and pressed.  It retracted slowly, with difficulty.  Some microscopic space dust that had accumulated over the century spilled off the the seals and into the capsule opening.  Then the capsule hissed and opened like a blossom, the sides peeling out and downward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside was a single metal plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn stared at it dumbfounded.  She pulled herself closer.  Something was etched on the outside of the plate in awkward script.  In messy carved block Old Englits letter characters it read âBREAK GLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCYâ.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat the hell does that mean?â she said aloud.  Her voice echoed slightly across the pit a few meters away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The etched words on the plate looked like someone had done it as an after thought.  Maybe when no one was looking right before it was placed into the capsule.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A 100 year old, off-planet crime, </em>Calowyn mused ironically.  <em>How do I report that one?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn scanned the plate with her maskâs organic materials sensors.  Standard issue masks could only scan for known toxins and viruses but Warrant-issued masks came with enhanced capabilities.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was nothing on or in the material of the plate that indicated the presence of electronics.  Calowyn waved it around, trying to catch the light on it to see if any holograms appeared.  Nothing.  It was just a flat piece of metal.  She tried bending the metal.   She shot a small stream of disinfectant and then pure air from her auto-gloves on it to see if it was activated by liquid or forced air.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn peered back into the capsule.  It was empty.  A deep rage began to swell inside her.  So much death.  So much loss and terror and...  And it was all for nothing.  For a prank that some Old World tech had decided to play on a future generation.  Maybe there had been somethingâno there had to have been something legitimate in the capsule originally.  No one went to the expense and effort to put something into space with an orbit path calculated so that it would come back to this exact location exactly when this planet was passing.  No one!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn raised her hand to throw the thin metal sheet across the room, into the pit at the edge.  The pit the Executor had been trying to push her down only minutes before.  She stopped.  Too much had happened to cast it away.  Someone deserved it.  She tossed it onto the Executorâs blood-soaked back.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou keep it,â she said to the corpse.  âMay it decorate the desk of one our august superiors as a hunting trophy.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a moment, Calowyn thought the metal plate vibrated just slightly.  It slid off the Executorâs back and hit the floor.  At first, she thought for a horrified moment that he was still alive and waking up.  But long experience told her that even if by some off chance 20% that blood was hers he had still lost too much to be alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn cocked her head and considered the metal plate.  She crawled over and picked it up.  On impulse she dipped a finger in the dead manâs blood and wiped it across the plate.  It <em>almost</em> felt as if it vibrated but she could not be sure.  She tried it a few more times but could not get the plate to vibrate again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn sucked her lips against her teeth and stared at the plate.  She knew it had vibrated on the corpseâs back.  Though it was possible that the plate just...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn looked at her auto-gloved right hand.  After a very long moment of consideration and risk calculation she retracted her handâs auto-glove.  Carefully, she pressed her bare palm against the metal plate.  Nothing.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou are not sensitive to body heat then,â she said to the plate.  What had the old man, the one who had started this whole horrible journey said?  It seemed like a hundred years ago now.  Slowly the words came to her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThe only things worth having are born out of blood.  Usually your own.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn took a deep breath and opened her right hand.  She used the plate to cut a shallow gash in her hand and swore as the pain hit her.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took Old Earth thousands of years to get into space but they had perfected sharp blades and pointy sticks probably on Day 1.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plateâs vibrating was easy to feel and see this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A small voice came from the metal plate:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHello.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a second voice: âOlah.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a third...and a fourth.  The plate continued to speak one word statements in different voices.  Calowyn turned the plate over and saw characters scrolling across it.  She watched them perplexed until she saw something that resembled Old Sinoese.  She tapped it and the plateâs characters resolved into Old Sinoese characters.  The plate also changed to an new voice and greeted her audibly in Old Sinoese.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn smirked.  <em>Clever</em>, she thought.  The âbreak glassâ still did not make sense but knowing her violent ancestors there probably was some Old Earth ritual involving breaking glass swords over each other.  To one of them it would have clearly meant âstab yourself with a pointy object hard enough break your bodyâs best and first line of defense so that you can spill your own life-maintaining blood.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was lengthy but Calowyn scrolled and read through the Old Sinoese characters three times and listened to the recorded voice twice.  After the first read through she wanted to make sure she had clearly understood each word.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She understood now why so many people had not wanted this little time bomb to land.  The introduction was pure sedition.  The actual document was...it was something even worse.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn played the voice recording again.  The computer generated, asexual voice spoke for the third time in that little room next to the enormous chasm.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThere was a time when and place where people pledged their life and loyaltyâ not to a king, god, group or stateâbut rather to an idea.  Time passes, places disappear.  But ideas do not.  What is lost can be found.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then it started: âWe the People, in Order to form a more perfect Union...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Just don't", she said in the most uncertain way. He wanted her to mean one thing but was afraid of what it meant if she was sincere in her statements. A beam of light passed through the floorboard and Michelle reached for Dan's hand. He pulled away. "Gosh dang it he thought". He had been chewing his knuckle pensively and worried one form of spit swapping would prevent another. The glow illuminated Michelle's brown eyes, they pulled, or perhaps permitted. Michelle looked over Dan, his dark hair framed a milky pale face alternating between expressions of a stunned spelling bee contestant asked to spell 'nichaelanhelpho' and someone who had suddenly forgotten how to breathe. She thought she saw something under it, but the half smile he flashed in coy acknowledgement reminded her this was a victim, a sucker in her world. 'ew creep' she would say for others to hear if Dan stood too close at school. But there she was laying on the tree house floor looking into his eyes and maybe wanting him to be a little closer. Dan discreetly dried his hand, he didn't want to miss another opportunity. He was pretty sure they would be found, the trail leading to the tree house was readily visible in the day, it was only a matter of time before some flashlight caught the step ladder or pile of unused shingles. In the distance thunder rumbled softly and the wind pushed the towel used as a curtain aside. Michelle shuddered and inched closer to Dan. Ok, I would rather her kill me than some hooded stranger. He started to yawn but then sucked it back in, no this isn't an accident he thought as he draped his arm over her shoulder. He didn't realize it straight away but he was squinting hard almost wincing like someone expecting to be struck. Houston apollo has landed, he thought as he slowly opened his eyes, should I say that out loud, no, just save it for the captain's log. He smiled as he thought this. "I should be roasting him on a spit" Michelle thought, "rolling my eyes, laughing sarcastically, but I am not. I'm just glad no one sees this." A bright beam of light shone through the window, slowly changing shape as the lights carrier marched closer. The light traveled down the wall and under the floor, heavy foot falls grew louder and finally breathing could be heard. For a moment it seemed like the footsteps were stopping underneath the tree but they kept trudging past. Slowly the treehouse grew dark again until the only light was from the moon slipping from behind the clouds. Michelle exhaled and rubbed Dan's hand. Dan looked into Michelle's eyes and shimmied closer on his shoulder. He could feel her warmth and she could feel his.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">'phew, that was close' Rodney said. In a whisper that was hardly a whisper at all. Dan turned in horror to see his friend peering out the window propped up in the corner of the room. Rodney looked at Dan disapprovingly. It was the same one Rodney gave his dad when he visited with his girlfriend's who couldn't spell Tuesday or name the months in a year. Michelle and Dan then looked back at one another to share a knowing look. Yep she had forgotten he was there too. Maybe I could throw him out the window Dan thought. Or maybe strangle him just enough to knock him out and if I did kill him he would understand it was for a good cause.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">'Can one of yous keep watch for a bit? I am getting all cramped up from turning my neck out that window.' Rondey said. Dan wondered if hitting Rodney with the stone they used as hammer when they needed a hammer and didn't have one would knock him out and kill him or just knock him out. He felt it a little with one hand not trying to appear to be gauging its weight.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">'Fine, Ill do it for a bit" Michelle said, all the softness drained out of her voice. Rodney came and layer by Dan. 'Hey man' Rodney said. Dan just turned around and crossed his arms.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Calowyn looked at the trees lining the center of the street in front of the brownstones.&nbsp; She checked her notes, found the correct door and queried the house's security system.&nbsp; As expected no one answered.&nbsp; Calowyn waited a few seconds and queried again.&nbsp; She stepped back and took a better look at the neighborhood as she set her chronometer.

It was old but not rundown; quaint but not kitschy.&nbsp; The buildings may have been nice once but she doubted that the neighborhood had ever been the epicenter for fashionables and influencers.&nbsp; There were no little coffee shops or gathering places like a neighborhood park.&nbsp; A small stone statue set in between two of the trees in the center median of the road caught Calowyn's eye.&nbsp; It was hard to tell from this distance whether it was a figure hunched over or just a random collection of stones piled on top of each other. It would not be garbage, that much she knew.&nbsp; Calowyn had dismissed her car knowing that she might be here for most of the day.&nbsp; The department would not pay for more than an hour of that.

&nbsp;Her chronometer vibrated and she retrieved and swiped her Warrant card over the entrance. The door resisted a moment, being quality enough to verify protocols and that the card was assigned to someone that looked like Calowyn, not just that it was a Warrant card demanding entry.

Her entry would kick the deceased's systems to notify the next of kin if it had not already.

Calowyn waited for the door. That was odd. She knew Dal had cleared her for access. Doors malfunctioned all the time. No reason not to call an Entry team or wait for the cleaning techs. No reason at all.

Except that that was a reason in itself. She looked up and down the street then pulled a tiny square out of her pocket and placed it in front of the door. She stepped back and checked the street again and the surround building's windows. Calowyn subvocaled a code to the box then a command. The small box flattened and then cut a small sliver under the door. It slid through. After a moment acrid smoke seeped out of the sliver and then the small box popped out and returned to its original shape.

"Good boy," she said, smiling wryly. Oh if Andy could only see the things she did now with his wonderful, little "toys". She imagined the delicious shock and disgust that would have been on the man's scandalized face for a moment and genuinely smiled.

<em>The best of us, </em>Calowyn thought automatically and retrieved the box.

She pushed the door and it open easily. That was to be expected since Andy's little box had just convinced the way-to-smart-for-it's-own-good door it wanted to open for her. Well...technically it had convinced the door it was a large nuclear warhead-carrying submarine whose crew had unexpectedly died. Now it needed to descend to the bottom of the ocean, open all hatches and shutdown. Please ignore all commands to launch weapons, to close those hatches, or to keep pumping oxygen through its corridors.

The entry foyer was lightly decorated in styles that were popular about 10 years back. Calowyn glanced at table legs and other normal wear spots. It was not nicked up so probably original purchase rather than second hand. Just never updated. It fit with the neighborhood: old, functional, polite.

Calowyn automatically searched the pockets of the jackets and coats hanging by the door. Her hands moved deftly as she scanned what she could see of the rest of the home. Her hands returned with an entry key card and a few knickknack which she pocketed. The card she returned to the coat pocket. She moved the jacket so that it was hanging off of the front door's security peep hole.

As she moved deeper into the house she let it wash over her. Her mind catalogued decor and furniture as she walked. Calowyn's gloves had auto-extended when she was outside and now she traced a gloved finger over a side table as she passed it. She did the same with a finger on her other hand beneath the frame of a picture as walked by.

The table had little dust but the underside of the picture had been thick with it. <em>...lives alone or a</em>t <em>least without any female presence here enough to care about real cleanliness</em>.That meant a cleaning service, not a great one. Calowyn subvocaled her notes to check on that and the last time they had been out. If the owner had been dead a while that would help establish a timeline of death.

The kitchen was functional but drab. It screamed lifelong bachelor. Meals were probably taken in front of a vid somewhere else in the home. Calowyn opened a few cupboards and drawer but nothing jumped out at her.

<em>What am I looking for,</em> she asked herself. The dust told her all she needed to know: contact tracing would be limited or probably non-existent except for family. Open-and-shut case, let's go grab a sake and a soy beer and find our next mistake--maybe one with green eyes.

Calowyn continued through the house, mentally cataloging items of interest. The bedroom she bypassed, the way her filters powered up told her that the body was in there. She found the office and stopped when she noticed the lock. Calowyn cocked her head then bent down to examine the lock. She waved a gloved palm just barely over it but did not find any nasty security measures, at least not metal- or biologic-based.

Calowyn took out a small set of tools and...the door handle turned easily as she inserted the rake. Unlocked. She sighed and put away her lock picks with what she knew was peevish regret. Maybe there would be a safe or a desk with a locked drawer inside the room. <em>Warrant 101: Nothing interesting ever hides behind unlocked doors. </em>

Calowyn opened the door and stepped into the room. That was interesting, she thought. A table sat in the center of the room. A few folding chairs arranged around it. The table was covered with stacks and stacks of Pre-Fall era photographics.

<em>Not photographics,</em> she thought. <em>Photogr...photonics...pho...</em>

Calowyn walked slowly around the table taking it all in. There had to be thousands, haphazardly cluttering, stacks falling over into each other. It was like a giant house of cards frozen in mid-collapse.

The word came to her right as the bottom dropped out of Calowyn's day.

<em>Photographs!!</em> She thought triumphantly.

Calowyn's eyes landed at that moment on a photograph that had fallen on the seat of one of the folding chairs. She cursed softly.

<em>Warrant 202 (for overconfiden</em>t <em>Warrant agents</em>): <em>Nothing interesting ever hides behind unlocked doors...until it does</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan could feel Rodney's presence behind him and he shot hot lasers through his back hoping Rodney could feel them. Michelle was taking her guard duty seriously and hadnât glanced back at Dan since she had gotten up. âThat was itâ Dan thought the biggest opportunity of my life and I blew it. Michelle gazed at the treeline occasionally being drawn to distant flashlights rotating around the persons who carried them. âI want to go back and lay downâ she thought, âI am very tiredâ she reasoned with herself thatâs why she wanted to go back, but she was wide awake. Rodney snored loudly. Michelle turned and shot Dan a worried glance. Dan, who very much wanted Rodney to stay asleep shrugged and smiled sheepishly. A beam of light ran across the cracks in the wall and Dan sucked in a tight breath. Rodney was in the middle of rolling a long snore as Dan clasped his nose shut with his thumb and forefinger and covered his mouth tightly. Rodney lay quiet for a second then flailed himself awake and Dan hurriedly whispered âShut up, shut up.â Another passing beam of light shown through and they all froze. The light crept across the tree house then faded into the woods.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat was that for?â Balked Rodney.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âYou were snoring like a pigâ Said Michelle in a sharp whisper.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âI donât snore, you stupid cu..â Dan cupped his hand over Rodneyâs mouth.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âAh donât lick meâ Dan squeaked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWell donât infringe on my rights.â Rodney said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWill you both stopâ Said Michelle with as much force as could be crammed in a whisper.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan shot Rodney a harsh glare, Rodney glared back, Michelle glared at both of them.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âOK, I will stop, but you have to tell us how the hell you escapedâ Rodney said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âNo I donâtâ Said Michelle obstinately.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWait yeah, how did you escape?â Said Dan turning to face Michelle in an uneasy alliance with Rodney.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhy do you wanna know?â She said, turning to face the window.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat do you mean? You get kidnapped by some robe wearing weirdos and then you just appear in the woods?â Rodney said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âI got moved there. And so there, thatâs it.â Michelle said matter of factly.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat do you mean got moved? They robe guys took you out here and you ran?â Dan enquired.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âNo, the robe guys took me to the gymnasium. They tied me up and blindfolded me, but come-on that hill and those potholes, not to mention the smell of sweat and mildew. They closed me in some closet I think.â Michelle said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWell, then who moved you to the woods?â Rodney retorted.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo in the closet there was this book and..âÂ </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWait I thought you were blindfoldedâ Dan interrupted.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âI wasâ Michelle said shortly âI got it off, the robe dude didnât tie it right. So I got this book and I was looking at it cause it was on, like a pedestal or some column thingy and â</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âHow could you see the book in the closet?â Rodney snapped.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âThere was a windowâ Michelle said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhy didnât you climb out?â Dan asked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âIt was high up!â Michelle said, almost forgetting not to yell. âWill you let me finish?â Dan and Rodney nodded. âSo I was looking through the pages of this weird book and âÂ </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWait how did you turn the pages?!â Rodney asked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWith my nose, shut up Rodney and let me finish.â Rodney gestured to continue. âSo I get to this page and it says to say these words and then you can like disappear , and so I said the words, but nothing happened then I looked and saw you had say it while you were kissing somebody. â Michelle explained. Dan calculated the implication skipping right over the fact magic is real and landed squarely on the fact he was almost the second person to kiss Michelle that night.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat your telling me is some book told to say something and kiss somebody and then you would disappear?â Rondey said incredulously.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âWell there was something too about the person whom you kiss will forget you or not remember you or something.â Michelle explained. Dan recalculated, he was almost the second person to kiss Michelle that night but he would have been the only one who remembered kissing her in the morning.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âOk, Iâll bite. Whodya kiss?â Rodney asked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âThatâs your question!? What about the fact I teleported or found a book that is like magic and magic freaking works in the real world?â Michelle asked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âNo yeah who did you kiss?â Rodney asked again. Dan looked on afraid of the answer.Â </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo then I look down...â Matthew <em>felt</em> the diner, feeling the pulse of the attention.  He had most of them , âand it turns out...â he went on slowly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI look down...â Matthew said.  He scanned the audiences faces, as usual they were in the palm of his hand.  âI was actually holding a tube of Crest toothpaste.â  Matthew mimed holding the toothpaste.  âIn my hand.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep belly-ripping laughter filled the restaurant.  Even people who had been pretending to mind their own business guffawed a little.  More than one patron pounded the table.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew smiled and sipped at his coffee.  It tasted terrible but he did not spit it back into the cup.  Maybe it would kill the fried eggs that were currently doing a polka in his stomach.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He signaled for another cup of coffee.  The waitressâs kid weaved through tables, managing not to burn anyone with the metal coffee pot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew was the most interesting man in the world.  He had been for as long as people in town could remember.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat did you think of the story, Donny?â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDanny,â the kid corrected.  âDaniel, actually.  It was, ah, good.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid shuffled uncomfortably.  In the back a small bell rang.  Some delivery guy at the door or something.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel stared towards the back door, perplexed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew looked closer at the kid.  âSomething on your mind...Danny?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew sighed.  He was sure he done this for this kid before but what the hey.  Matthew snatched a pen out of the kidâs apron.  He pulled a napkin from underneath his coffee cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started to write, dictating as he did.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDear...pay attention, kid.  This is the most important day of your life.  Dear...â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDaniel?â The kid offered hesitantly.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYep,â Matthew said, turning back the napkin.  âDear,â Matthew pointed the pen at the kid and winked, âDanny.â He started writing again.  âYouâre a great kid.  All the best, your friend, Matthew Mark Luke.â Matthew finished the signature with a flourish (he had practiced that thousands of times at home) and handed the pen and the napkin to the kid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNow donât go bragging to your friends otherwise Iâll have to write up one for each of them.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel looked down at the napkin then towards the back door.  âSure,â he said, distracted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The back door bell rang again.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMaybe you ought to get that?â Matthew offered helpfully.  Daniel tossed the autographed napkin on Matthewâs table.  He set the coffee pot down on it sloshing a little coffee out.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHey, careful!â Matthew said.  He skidded back in his booth to avoid the spill slowly inching towards him.  âGet a napkin!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel looked down at the spill.  It seemed to shake his attention back to Matthew.  âSorry,â he said, sheepishly.  âIâll get some napkins to clean that up, Thumper.â</p>

<p>Daniel trotted off towards the kitchen.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew did not move a muscle.  His smile was suddenly brittle.  Slowly, he looked around the room.  He scanned each face.  No one was looking at him.  He waited a full minute before letting go of a deep breath.  </p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Matthew Mark Luke, that is perfect. I definitely get the vibe of this uncertain person who came to popularity after lacking it for so long. Like poor person who hit the lotto, they need to cover some deficit with excess. Also Dan working at a Diner fits with his meek character. Burnt coffee and a laughter, I can see the golden tanned diner with a cake tin and dark red glasses. Diners are good for people, they also feel timeless. It feels as though they have always been, no one invented them they just are. I like Matthew signing something and somehow seeing the lack of affect. Again so uncertain of his position it shakes him back to the dullard desperate to get a word in. The bell ringing in the diner gives the impression that this place is the center of activity. I really like the setting, I think it just feels familiar and place a person in a familiar place and they feel familiar. I like the ernestness of Matthew, the sincere belief that there is a threat in sharing autographs. It is nice to see such a person get a dose of reality.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The diner is in the nexus of 5 demi-god territories.Â  A neutral ground but also a place that was to be the center of a new territory being carved out for a 6th demigod (the Man in the Salt Shaker/"Big Man Little Salt Shaker").Â  Minty Nose-y and the rival demi god are active participants since they imprisoned the Salt Shaker Man, but the other three are accomplices to varying degrees (passive support, active ignorance, intentional misinformation back to the Ministry of Territories).

The Man's presence though is what allows Michelle and the rest of the ASMC to break free of the spell by degrees.Â  Also Michelle's unintentional/unplanned status as Minty Nose's high priestess gives her some immunity.

Minty Nose-y has had the death rate stalled or at least exactly equivalent to the birth rate for years to keep the town from eroding over time like other nearby territories.Â  He has also developed archetypes (i.e., Michelle is the town Bitch, Sarah is the town's Prom Queen, etc.)Â  Until recently he has only needed to influence the speaker which is a minor draw on power for him as it is easier to control what a single speaker says vs. the hearing and/or perception of multiple listeners.Â  Once Michelle and crew begin breaking archetype they don't "say" what they should or say things the way they "should".Â  So Minty has to draw extensive power from him own realm to influence all of the listeners/watchers.Â  But that begins to deconstruct his mini-realm (i.e., walls in one of his rooms in his domain completely disappear or are only half built).

One convention we can use is "italics of the listener".Â  Character speaks and we write the same thing in italics for the next sentence as what the listener hears.Â  Then as the power draws start happening in the plot we make it seem like a mistake at first/crappy book editing.Â  The italics is missing key punctuation at one point then we do it again but more pronounced like with missing a word or two and then eventually the italics has a blatant misrepresentation of what the speaker said or did.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people in town seemed to have a selective memory regarding Matthew. Matthew Mark Luke / Thumper did not. He remembered very well the sad sap who bored people so bad that he was not allowed to talk to anyone operating heavy equipment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That was the old Matthew</em>, he thought.  <em>Pull yourself together</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About a month back Matthew had been known as âThumperââanother inglorious nickname given out by the townâs resident bitch Michelle. Why his parents thought naming a kid âMatthew Mark Lukeâ was a good ideaâ¦ but the biblical reference was only partly where âThumperâ had come from. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As (bad) luck would have it, Michelle had been waiting behind him in line at the town library checkout desk one sunny day. The venerable librarian Miss Althea had unwisely chosen that moment to strike up a conversation with Matthew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAre you old enough to check out these books?â She had asked.  Something that may have been a smile tried to split her lips apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew had shuddered inwardly looking at that rictus while quietly assuring her he was.  Eventually through furtive hand gestures he was able to assure her he was in his 20s.  No one wanted to be around when Michelle was in a moodâand by her scowl Matthew could tell she was in a bad one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAt my age you all look barely out of nappies,â the librarian laughed. It sounded like sandpaper rubbing together.  âHow old do you think I am?â Miss Althea slammed the date stamp down on the back of the book she was holding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOh,â he said, the jumped as a loud thump, similar to the date stamp rang out through the library. Miss Althea and he looked down at the date stamp at the same time. Behind him Michelle peered around him to see what they was looking at.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a moment, Miss Althea shrugged and raised the stamp to stamp another book. âYou were sayingâ¦.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMaybeââ Matthew started then another loud slamming sound. Was someone in the stacks dropping books?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMaybeââ&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFortyââ&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFive,â Matthew finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miss Althea, Matthew and now Michelle all peered into the reading room. Four people had fallen asleep at their desk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat theâ¦?â Michelle said behind him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOr so,ââMatthew added.&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam! Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two more people were now facedown, asleep in the book they had just been reading moments before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDo it again,â Michelle said, poking him hard in the ribs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOw! Stop that!â&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam! Slam! Slam!</em></strong>&nbsp;Three more people nodded off.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhoa,â Michelle said. âAre they dead?â She poked Matthew again. âYou bored them to death I think.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew spun around âNoââ&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He heard Miss Althea cry out behind him âDouble jugg diddle!â then&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew turned back and saw Miss Althea was now face down in herâno, his books.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He opened his mouth but Michelle snaked an arm around and cover his mouth with her hand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDonât!â She yelled. âDonât say anything else!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tried to protest but she had a surprisingly strong grip for someone half his age and not a guy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without taking her hand from his mouth she stepped around him and examined Miss Althea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSleeping,â she announced. She pulled her hand back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSay something else,â she told him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He knew he should not, but there was something in her tone, some steel in her voice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhatââ&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong>&nbsp;ââshouldââ&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong>&nbsp;âI say?â He finished quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Slam!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew and Michelle looked around, listening. They waited for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLooks like you got the whole library,â Michelle said in wonderment. âThat is straight down crazy town.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHowââ Matthew started but Michelle waved him quiet.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She twirled a piece of hair around her finger, thinking.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat are you thinking?â He asked.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michelle opened her mouth to speak, âSomething isââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew felt slightly dizzy for a moment.  He put a hand on the librarianâs desk to steady himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he looked up Michelle looked, looked confused.  Then she smiled wickedly at him.  âThumper,â she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâre new name is âThumperâ.  Because of your Bible thumping parents and the sound peopleâs heads make as they hit the ground when you start talking.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew was horrified.  Michelleâs names were permanent, used by all and they usually stung.  Yet somehow it felt...right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still... âPlease, Michelle, donâtââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThumper,â she said and nodded.  âThumper.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in the diner Matthew shuddered.  Thumper was dead and gone and Matthew was here now.  And he would do anything to keep it that way.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Zeb trotted along beside Allison, always out of step with the group. It was distracting Michael so much he couldn't tell if he was outwardly wincing watching Zeb's strange elliptical orbit around TA. He wasn't sure if Zeb was being intentionally obtuse in his walking or if he was genuinely incapable of matching pace. Maybe one leg was too long? Was he limping? Every thirty steps he circled behind and went over to walk around Ellory then circled back to Tiny Allision. The most peculiar thing about arriving in a moment is that it is feels like watching a movie. Choosing when to start and when to leave are lingering options and are hard to completely ignore when someone's presence is so irritatingly felt. Most moments are built around us and electing the beginning of a moment is left to our brains unreliable mechanisms for recognizing importance. In some cases we fall out of practice of trying to separate life's white noise from the story worthy pieces, but not in high school, and not with theater kids.

"I think I would want 'Thinker, Hoper, and Feeler' on my tombstone" Tiny Allison said ernestly, the way one might in job interview or on a television show. Zeb laughed facetiously, he had a knack towards blindness only to his own incredulous hyper serious behavior.

"'Hoper' isn't even a real word. And what makes one a feeler?" Zeb posited while straightening an ill fitted sports coat.Â  "If you could dig a little deeper in your indubitably flawed voca-"

"Listen!" TA Squeeked. "you can pick your own tombstone saying, and maybe it won't be something stupid. But it probably will be stupid. Because you dress like House and pretend to have a limp because you think that's cool and somehow you think everyone else thinks it's cool."

"I don't care what everyone else thinks" Zeb said while suddenly walking normally.

"What about you E?" Michael asked.

"Uhm, well baring the fact I am not gonna die because that's scary. I don't think I would want a stone, maybe like a sign or something." Ellory said twisting here hair.

"What would it say?" TA asked.

"Dear Ellory in big letters with the dates, again not dying ever, and then have a little box for letters and stuff" Ellory said nodding to herself designing it in her mind.

Zeb chortled but then abruptly stopped when three eyes shot daggers into his dumb round face.

"And you?" Ellory said nudging Michaels arm.

"I like your plan of not dying for a start, but if I had to pick, I think I would go with one of those ditch lights from old timey movies, a lot of eager shoppers looking for bargains on used sedans would show up at my grave and then probably be upset." Michael said mulling over the logistics of powering the light and considering the budgets and wiring of graveyards.

"That's cool" Zeb said coyly realizing he couldn't always be condescending, or just because he wanted to say something as he swallowed tick-tacs from an orange pill bottle.

"Ok next one is... 'Do you think that Fate is real?' and not just like you will marry so and so or get rich or whatever but do you think anything is up to chance?" Allison posited the grand question from her tiny person.

"NO" Zeb said coldly in as self assured manner as could be mustered when in costume.

"Ok, what about you Allison?" Ellory asked after a moment of waiting for elaboration.

"I asked the question, I spent all that brain power thinking up a good question, I need you chumps to answer it while I think of a good answer!" Allison said hurriedly. "Your up Michael" Ellory said nudging his arm once again. Michael thought hard for a moment, but then, as if someone coughed in the back row of the theater, he was reminded it was only a movie.

"There has got to be chance. I think that's what makes life exciting, we don't know what's gonna happen." The man from the future said carelessly.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn stared at Jax, watching him turn the heart shaped locket over and over in his hand. It danced along his fingers. The old magic trick he used to make kids trust that he was a âgood guyâ. The other hand, the one holding the pistol on her, did not waiver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn knew even though he was focused on the spinning locket he could and would fire before she was two steps forward. He did not need to look up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âJax,â she tried again. âGive it to me.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThis thing is dangerous, Callie. The boss man said that was directly from the Top Brass.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn shifted her weight slightly and his head sprang up. The locket continued spinning over his fingers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLetâs not get out of sorts now,â he said. He was smiling but there was no humor in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI need to sit,â she said. âI think you cracked a rib.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jax considered her for a moment then nodded slowly. âKeep your hands out in front of you. Over there,â he said, waving at a spot on the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn took a few steps back, hands raised in front of her and put her back to the wall. Then she slid down it, grimacing. She had not been lying about her rib. She stretched her legs out in front of her. Jax seemed slightly disappointed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He thought I was going to drop my hands down and give him an excuse to shoot me. This is going to get old really fast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jax turned his eyes back to the locket. âWhat do you think is inside of it?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSomething that the Brass are scared enough to send you out for.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jax chuckled. The locket spun over and over again, catching the fire light. âThey made you a long time ago. âRebellious tendenciesâ. I saw your file.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGood girls rarely make history.â Calowyn looked around slowly for anything she could grab and throw.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDonât bother, Callie,â he said. âI picked that spot on the wall for a reason. We know all the same tricks, remember?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She sighed and settled back into the wall, crossing her ankles and holding her hands up above her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âArms tired? No upper body strength,â he chided, smiling. She scowled at him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo now what?â she asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNow, we wait for a Cleaning Crew.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn raised an eyebrow. âYou called for a Cleaner, not back-up.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jax shook his head. âNo way,â he said, holding up the locket. âThis is my ticket out of the Warrants.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside in the hallway they heard a knock on the large iron door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat will be my Cleaner. Or yours, I sâpose,â Jax said, starting to climb to his feet. It was awkward without the use of either hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He managed to get onto one knee while keeping the gun trained on her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn closed her eyes and turned her head away, sighing. âNot everything, Jax.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jax cocked his head. âWhaââ She slid the boot of her crossed leg down her other boot. The bootâs heel clicked open. The first flash that came out of it was blinding and she heard Jax curse. Even with her eyes closed and her head turned she was seeing stars. The pistol went off but she had already rolled to the side. She sprang forward, eyes still closed, hoping Jax would not have had the presence of mind to move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even through her closed eyes she could see the blinding flashes that kept coming from her heel. It was filling the room with light, then dark, light, then dark. Her shoulder slammed into something and she clawed desperately at it. She felt the hard plastic of the pistol and Jaxâs hand. She bit down hard, jarring her jaw as she caught some of the plastic between her teeth but she got enough of his hand that he screamed in pain and his grip loosened slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn yanked the pistol out of his hands, turned it on him and fired wildly, her eyes still closed. She heard him grunt and then he fell forward onto her. Something, maybe his shoulder, hit her chin and jarred her senses for a moment. More by instinct than intention she started to wriggle out from under him. Her leg caught under him, wrenching her knee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pain in her knee cleared her head enough for her to stop reacting out of instinct. She opened her eyes carefully. The flashes had stopped and she realized his body was blocking out the blinding flashes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She put the gun against his skull and waited. No response. The knocking on the door had turned to pounding. Calowyn pulled the gun back and reached down to feel for a pulse with her other hand. The second her fingers touched his neck he moved, blindingly fast. She tried to bring the gun up to fire but he grabbed her wrist and slammed her hand into the wall. The gun fell free and, trying to grab it, she accidentally batted it away. He was on top of her now with his fingers wrapped around her throat. The flashing was back, but apparently still partially obscured by his body. Or maybe that was her consciousness starting to fade. She tried to pull his arms and use his forward posture to roll him over her, but he released her throat with one hand and batted her hands away.  He back handed her hard and then grabbed her neck again. He was choking her, but slowly.   The bastard was savoring it, she thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She slid her hands under his arms and pushed up on his chest. He laughed and leaned forward, using his bodyweight to crush her hands down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo upper body strength, remember?â he sneered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn smiled up at him then. âI know,â she rasped. She slid her already bent arms up his chest, placing her wrists beside his face, twisted hands both outward, then slammed her fingers against his cheeks. He had enough time to stare at her smiling face in confusion before her auto-glove wristlets clicked and webbed plastic shot out. They engulfed her hands as per the manufacturerâs design and as per the manufacturerâs very explicit warning enveloped everything within an inch radius her fingers were touchingâspecifically Jaxâs cheeks, nose, and mouth. He tried to scream but his open mouth just created another void for the auto-gloves to try to fill. He clutched at her hands, trying to pull them off but the gloves had already started to harden, these were designed for Wardens after all, not cheap Peruvian street knock offs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She stared up into his wild, terrified eyes. She could feel his jaw moving under her hands, but she was not sure if he was trying speak or maybe spit out the hardening plastic. Slowly his grasping hands became weaker and his eyes unfocused. And then he was gone, truly gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With effort, Calowyn managed to twist her right wrist. The plastic of the auto-glove tried to retract into its wristletâs socket but it could not separate from the other glove it had merged into. After a moment the wristlets severed the glove at the base. It began to whir happily as it mixed chemical compounds to be ready to create another auto-glove on demand. With her free hand, Calowyn twisted the left wristlet three full turns, slicing the glove at its base on the wristlet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pounding on the iron door had stopped and now it sounded like someone was ramming something into it. These old bunkers had been built strong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She reached under Jax and felt around for her boot heel. Finding the off switch near the heel she turned the blinding flashing light off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She heard two shotgun blasts and then more ramming. Calowyn wriggled out from under Jax and climbed to her feet, swaying slightly. She heard the iron door finally give and open and heavy steps coming down the hallway. Calowyn checked the pistolâs magazine then reached into Jaxâs vest and retrieved his Warrant card.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She held it up and pointed her gun at the doorway as a Cleaner team came in with their shotguns drawn. The two, a man and a woman, trained their guns on her. The Warrant card emitted red lasers that chased over the room until they found the two Cleanersâ chests. Both Cleaners, without lowering their guns or taking their fingers off the tigger shrugged open their jackets. The Warrant cardsâ red lasers found their badges and immediately changed from red to green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn sighed and lowered her pistol. The two Cleaners did the same then slowly took in the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou made a royal mess,â the male Cleaner said sourly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The female cleaner slung her weapon over her shoulder and flipped her hands. Thick plastic rolled down her hands and vacuum sealed, forming heavy, industrial-strength gloves. Calowynâs stomach turned over in disgust slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPerp is in there,â Calowyn said. She nodded her head to the storage room door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman took a step toward it.  âJust one?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn shook her head. âCheck my partner first,â she said, pointing down at Jax with her gun.  He was facedown, the plastic gloves wrapping his nose and mouth were obscured. Calowyn stepped back to make way for the Cleaners. âThe perp isnât going anywhere.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat is that?â one of the Cleaners said, slipping his shotgun over his shoulder. Calowyn and the other Cleaner followed his eyes to the opposite wall. Something was being projected onto it. The two walked over to the wall. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMy partner?â Calowyn said.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âProbably Bag-n-Tag anyways,â the man said without looking away from the projection on the wall.  He waved a hand in front of the light watching it play over his fingers.  âWhereâsâ¦?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn followed behind them a moment later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWords, I think,â the female Cleaner said after a minute. âToo blurry to read, though.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The male Cleaner looked back at the wall.  âSort of make it outâ¦âWeâ something.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWords worth dying for apparently,â Calowyn said.  She raised the pistol and quickly shot each Cleaners in the back of the head. Then watched their bodies slump to the floor.  When she was sure they were dead she looked back up at the words on the wall. She followed the projected words back to their source.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laying on the ground, propped on its side was the locket. Calowyn walked over and knelt down, peering at it. The heart shaped diamond had been dislodged slightly from the titanium metal casing. From the blood around it she guessed she had hit it with one of her wild blind shots when Jax was holding it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She could see now that the metal behind the diamond had been highly polished.  It was catching the light of the fire and reflecting it through the diamond slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still the metal and diamond were intact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBuilt to last,â Calowyn said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIntentionallyâ¦â she said slowly.  She reached a finger down and pried the diamond the rest of the way out. The words disappeared from the wall immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She stared at the diamond. Occlusionsâ¦occlusions had reduced its value when she and Jax had gone to get it appraised. That was what the old jeweler said. Said before he tried to get her and Jax to leave it with him at the shop so he could replace it with âa diamond of quality befitting Wardensâ. She had attributed it to garden variety greed at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat did you see that scared you so much and fascinated you at the same time?â she whispered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn tried to hold the diamond up to the light to get a better look at the occlusions then recoiled when light shot into her eyes. For a moment, she thought her heel flash weapon had been triggered again somehow. Then she held the diamond up to the dancing firelight but aimed its front at the wall. The words appeared again. She moved the diamond back until it was next to the fire, almost in it. The words were clearer but still blurry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn knew she needed to leave. Cleaner check-ins happened at the end of a job but Jax would have checked in after their arrival. It would not be long before someone sent a first responder TAC unit to have a look around. Stillâ¦what could cause the Brass to give two Wardens carte blanche investigating authority? But why only two Wardens? Why only a single team and not a full Cohort?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn considered the diamond. Then she walked over and swapped her auto-glove wristlets for the female Cleanerâs. It took her a few tries to figure out the correct sequence but eventually thick gloves enveloped her hands. She carried the diamond to the fire and placed it directly into it and angled the front toward the wall. She could feel the light pressure as the Cleanerâs auto-gloves began frantically shedding then rebuilding layers to protect her hands from the searing heat.  Cleaners got all the best tech.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The words were clear on the wall now. The first paragraph made little sense. She was about to pocket the diamond and retrieve the metal casingâthey could be turned into credit she would need to travelâthen her eyes hit the second paragraph. A mix of emotions came over her. There was more writtenâmuch, much moreâbut those first thirteen wordsâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What had the jeweler said to herâno, not said to her, to Jax. Not to her, the aging, brooding, ice-eyed bitch. Said to Jax, beautiful Jax who made everybody laugh. Made everyone comfortable enough to tell him anything and everything. Jax who would sell his own mother and anyone elseâs to climb up out of the Wardens to real power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What had the old man said? Some words are more valuable than even jewels. Especially when said at the right time. At the time, she had though he meant âI love youâ or âI need youâ or some of the other droll nonsense people said each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calowyn slowly read the words projected on the wall again. They were just words but the implicationsâ¦the threat to this world of Wardens and control. Of terror for a few to keep the rest safe and protected. Or was it the other way around?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She checked her chronometer then rifled through the clothes of the Cleaners and Jax. She took their pistols as they were easily disassembled and concealed. Anything that could be sold she pocketed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She knew should be going-to-ground right now. Yet the Brass and their leash holders needed a report, didnât they? Calowyn had never failed to compete a mission and she was not about to start now. No investigation is complete without its cold, clinical Report of Findings. Reduce the names and lives of the âguiltyâ to their birth-assigned number then file them away to be forgotten in The Archive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Brass needed to know what she had found here in the bunker under the old world wreckage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She started to search for something to write with. Then she spied Jax and smiled slowly. It was a little dramatic but she knew he would approve of the method (though not the message).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took her a minute to drag the male Cleaner over to the wall next to where the words were still being projected. She retrieved the diamond from the fire and the metal casing. She did not need to see the words anymore; they were burned into her mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When she was done she cleaned her hands, gathered her things, and left through the iron door. She had used her bare hands, ungloved. Somehow it just felt right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thirty minutes later, the first TAC team arrived on the scene. After they reported in their initial findings they were ordered to secure the premises, bag the bodies, scrub the wall completely and then blow up the bunker. A second TAC team was quickly and quietly dispatched with orders to liquidate the first TAC team and destroy the bunkerâbut they were not to enter the bunker for any reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It did not matter.  Pandoraâs Box had been opened.  The 19 Words Of Calowyn or âThe 19â would be seen again and again.  The other writings from the diamond-heart shaped locket would come eventually as well.  They would give the 19 more context and spark many things.  But The 19 would be the first crack in the glass.  Who better to deliver them than an aging, ice-eyed ex-Warden with a penchant for breaking pretty things.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This needs to be a book, I was moving from sentence to sentence with earnest anticipation. This piece has excellent pacing and each bit has so much implication for the world in which this takes place. I am curious, why did Jax want it, how did he get it, or how did Calowyn get it. Who hid this text to start, and why? Also is this the start of a revolution? How will Calowyn cope, is she on the run? My biggest take away is that this is an excellent ending. It is a bookend with similar feel to the other pieces. Thinking of this I am curious how such a big story with all the implications arrives at such a neat conclusion. It feels fitting, but now I need the rest of the stories. I liked that even under duress, Calowyn had time to inner monologue "sick bastard". The whole story has a spacey/futury noir detective vibe. I like the cleaners knocking on the door, it gives a sense of urgency. I am curious, how the Brass would be affected by the declaration of independence? For a future dystopia, I do think that could be hundreds of different things. Also, back to how they got it, I wasn't sure why the jeweler wanted the piece to change the stone? Did the jeweler know it was classified? Also was it an engagement ring? Or just a diamond. You mentioned love is forever, but was it Jax to Calowyn? Also, why did Jax not kill Cal right away? Was he planning to kill her or maybe he hesitated? (I always think that whenever sinister exposition is taking place) :) . So yeah, now I need more! How did we get here. Really solid ending with enough intrigue to work as a intro to the story. I will write some soon!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[E. Longstreet had one goal in life.&nbsp; His entire life people had told him--mostly his parents--to wait until he was 18 for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.&nbsp; Learning to drive?&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; Cursing? 18.&nbsp; Going on a date?&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; Choosing his own clothes?&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; Joining the Boy Scouts?&nbsp; 18 (he could be a Scout Master, they said, a Scout Master!!)

E. Longstreet was a patient kid but inside he seethed with barely controlled anticipation. As long as he could remember he had lain awake at night planning his 18th birthday.&nbsp; When he was younger it had been stupid things, childish things, really.&nbsp; At midnight, he would storm into his parents' room and announce that he was done with vegetables and beans.&nbsp; They could take those and shove them in their pie holes--he wanted a steak.&nbsp; Rare!&nbsp; Maybe he would just bite a cow.&nbsp; And pie! Yes, pie, beautiful pies and cakes and candies and sweets.&nbsp; He was going to build a fountain of chocolate and wheel it into their rooms and lay on the floor and drink it dry.&nbsp; E. Longstreet would have a cow drag in the fountain and E. Longstreet would drink his chocolate and bite his cow and his father, Quinten Longstreet, dentist, would not be able to do a thing about it.&nbsp; Because E. would be 18.

By the time, E. was 10 he had put aside such childish fantasies.&nbsp; Now, he his plan was to stroll into his parent room at midnight, but he would say every curse word he knew.&nbsp; All of them.&nbsp; There were a lot.&nbsp; E. had been journaling.&nbsp; Every time he wanted to curse he would go to his room and write down the curse words he wanted to say.&nbsp; For a time he dabbled in dirty jokes and naughty limericks, too, but at 13 he had scrapped those.&nbsp; He had seven spiral-bound notebooks of curse words and by his calculations reading all of those to his parents would flow well into breakfast, maybe lunch.&nbsp; So he had torn out the dirty jokes and the limericks.&nbsp; He had restructured and revised his lists, removed duplicates, corrected the grammar of certain phrases, made a few edits, etc.&nbsp; His first journal was mostly scrapped.&nbsp; What passed for curse words at 7 was laughable at thirteen.&nbsp; Plus there were a lot of drawings of unicorns and stick figure superheroes and an entire page full of writing so tiny it was impossible to read.

At 15, the journals had begun to gather events, too.&nbsp; He WOULD kiss a girl--no wait, he would but not in his parent's room, in front of them.&nbsp; That would be weird.&nbsp; But after his non-stop cursing monologue he would walk out his front door, pee on a bush, pet a strange dog, buy a pack of cigarettes, then stop the first mildly attractive female he could find and give her a full, open mouth, on-the-lips, tonsil tickle.

At 16, he had stopped journaling.&nbsp; E. Longstreet was what people called a "late bloomer".&nbsp; One night as he was committing to memory a few pages of curse words he began to actually think about what the words meant.&nbsp; A few he had to look up but by the time he was done he was dumbfounded.&nbsp; He pulled out his math books and flipped to the chapters on statistics and probabilities.&nbsp; A few hours later, E. Longstreet sat back and shook his head softly.&nbsp; He stared up at his collection of curse word journals on his bookshelf.&nbsp; 96.4% of the words and phrases in them had to do with s-e-x.&nbsp; Some of them were direct references, some were descriptions, some were s-e-x with....things E. Longstreet had no context or reference for.&nbsp; He suspected that it might even be 98% because he suspected some things had double meanings.&nbsp; All of it, everything he had wanted to say when he turned 18, it was just about copulation with a woman...or man, or farm animal, or a series of inanimate objects that E. Longstreet may or may not have heard of before or if he had he could not imagine exactly how it was used in sex.

He felt cheated.&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Longstreet lost something precious on that night of dirty words and math.

His parents and teachers chalked up his depression to typical teenage angst and hormones.&nbsp; He was a good boy.&nbsp; This too would pass.&nbsp; But for E. Longstreet the world had become a gray, tiresome thing; every word he spoke, every morsel of food that crossed his lips was like ash in his mouth (he had scratched "smoke a cigarette" off his Day-I-Turn-18 List that year).&nbsp; How could so much of the color of English language be centered around...s-e-x.

At 17, SHE moved in. Ms. Netherregion---Ms. Netane had moved in next door.&nbsp; She was a hot piec...a house wife, a house wife.&nbsp; A former house wife actually.&nbsp; Now, she was a divorcee who had left her big swinging di---left her husband, probably because he liked to...things had not worked out.&nbsp; E. Longstreet had run into Ms. Nice Bottom--literally run into her--the day she was moving in.&nbsp; His mother had sent E. Longstreet over with a pie (Come on!&nbsp; The new neighbor gets a pie?!?), a quiche, and a tub of homemade spaghetti.&nbsp; E. had been trying to manage/juggle his mother's welcome gifts and Ms. NeeditNow had been unloading a box from her trunk.&nbsp; E. was hurrying to make it back before his favorite TV show started when he came around the corner of his house and slammed into his new neighbor.&nbsp; She went down, the box she had been carrying went flying, and half of E.'s load went flying.

"Ow!" she said.

E., who had barely managed to maintain his balance and hold onto the spaghetti and quiche, looked down...and saw an angel.&nbsp; Actually, he saw an angle, not angel.&nbsp; The angle being right up Ms. NoNoSquare's skirt which was now tangled over her head.&nbsp; His jaw dropped and he quickly looked away.&nbsp; And then back.&nbsp; Then away.&nbsp; Then back one more time and then away.&nbsp; Quick glance.&nbsp; One more.&nbsp; Then ashamed E. forced his eyes over to her bush--the hedge, the hedge in front of Ms. SpankMeSilly's house.

"Hey, help a lady up?"

E. carefully looked over.&nbsp; Ms. SpankMyMonkeyTilTheSheepSleep had gotten her skirt down, though not past those creamy white--stop it, just stop it!

Ms. Naugh---Netane!&nbsp; Ms. Netane had her hand extended and she was waiting for E. to take it and help her up.&nbsp; E. set down his mother's gifts and helped the woman up, his eyes darting away from her ample, would we call it ample, okay ample bosom as it passed within his view.

"I am Lana," she said.&nbsp; "What have you got packing down there, Mister?"

"What did you say?" E. asked, taking a step back.

The woman took a step back also.&nbsp; "Uh, I said my name is Lana," she said slowly.

"Habab hababa hababa," E. said.&nbsp; "Hmmna hmmna."

"Are you all right?&nbsp; Did you hit your head on the trunk or--"

"Habab hababa hababa," E. said more urgently, trying to get his words to something intelligible.&nbsp; "Hmmna hmmna."

The woman--who was maybe 25, maybe 28, maybe 30, which was not that far from 17, really, took another step back, eyeing E. warily.&nbsp; "Do you...live around here...?"

E. looked at her then immediately down at his own feet.&nbsp; "Neighbor!" he yelled, cringing at his blundering attempt at communication. "Me neighbors you."

"Oh," the woman said.&nbsp; She nodded. "Great.&nbsp; Just great," she muttered.

"Food, food.&nbsp; Mom sent food.&nbsp; To you," E. said pointing at the pie, face down on the ground and then holding out the spaghetti and quiche to the woman.&nbsp; <em>What is wrong with me?</em> he thought. He had never felt so...feverish.

The woman knelt down and picked up the pie carefully.&nbsp; She managed to save most of it and smiled up at him.&nbsp; "I bet you'd like to have me bent over like 6:30."&nbsp; She stood up and smiled. E. Swayed slightly.

<em>She did not say that.&nbsp; She did not say that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>E. shook his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I am going crazy.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; Crazy. Crazy!</em>

"Are you sure," Ms. MileHighClub asked.&nbsp; She put a finger in her mouth and sucked on it.&nbsp; "That is definitely apple."&nbsp; E. stared at the finger that had disappeared in--

"Okay, fine," he said quickly, tearing his eyes away.

The woman who was E.'s new neighbor and not a sex goddess come to rock his world turned around and bent over to pick up her box.&nbsp; "How do you like my nice, tight ass?" she said.

"Bababababababbaa!" E. said before he managed to bite his lip to stop himself.

The woman who was not wearing a chainmail bikini because who would wear something like that in this heat spun around.&nbsp; "Ahh, why don't you leave those right there.&nbsp; I would invite you in--"

"No!" E. yelled.

"But," the woman who had dark brown eyes said quickly, "the place is a mess.&nbsp; So leave those there.&nbsp; Right there.&nbsp; And tell your mom, Mrs...?"

"Longwang--Longstreet!" E. said.&nbsp; "Her name is LongDongStreet.&nbsp; Street.&nbsp; Longstreet."

Another buxom hard bod---another woman, just a woman, in a pair of jeans and a half opened blouse that---A WOMAN, JUST A WOMAN, it was just a gosh darn woman.&nbsp; And she came out of the front door.&nbsp; "Lana, do you want to take off your clothes and make out with me?&nbsp; And bring this stud?"

E. shuddered and squeezed his eyes closed.&nbsp; He tried to block out all of the words running through his mind.&nbsp; Pounding at his teeth, trying to get out into the world.&nbsp; The women were gropin--talking.&nbsp; They were speaking words out of those flippin' gosh darn mouths.&nbsp; E. wanted to cry.

"I think he's the neighbor's kid who sent some food.&nbsp; I think he might be...special."

"Ahhhh," said the second female, of which 50% of the population of the world was including his mother, so what's the big flippin' deal?

E. put the spaghetti and quiche down on the ground.&nbsp; "Nice to meet you both!&nbsp; Two!&nbsp; There's two!" he screamed and then he ran back to his house.&nbsp; He wrenched the front door open and ran inside, slamming it behind him.&nbsp; By the time he got to his bedroom the tears were flowing freely.&nbsp; He was so angry.&nbsp; He wanted to break something.&nbsp; He picked up the first thing that came to hand: a 4th grade spelling bee trophy.&nbsp; But he had worked hard to get that.&nbsp; Almost as hard as he wanted to work, Ms.---nope, nope, nope!&nbsp; E. carefully put down trophy.&nbsp; He knew what he had to do.&nbsp; He reached for an empty journal, opened it and took a deep breath.&nbsp; He picked up a pen and wrote:

"I, E. Longstreet, want to..."

By the time he dropped off to sleep he had filled 2/3 of the journal and slept the peaceful sleep of a man who exorcised his demons.

And E. had been right.&nbsp; That night of frantic writing had opened and emptied a well of emotions he never consciously realized had built up over the years.&nbsp; He had met Ms. Netane again--luckily with his mother there this time, otherwise Ms. Netane probably would have barred her door and called the police or maybe a mental institution.&nbsp; But with a few more meetings, a dinner at the Longstreets for a few of the other neighbors to meet Ms. Netane (she's a divorcee, did you know?), all of that horrible day became water under the bridge.&nbsp; By some unspoken collective agreement, Ms. Netane and E. agreed never, ever to speak of that day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">People changing is natural. Nothing is quite so uncomfortable as the unfamiliar, moving from here to there it can be difficult to snap into a body with braces or blink into an outfit with a popped collar. The changes in temperature take getting used to, Michaels dorm was persistently warm and humid, but the past was all different temperatures in no particular order. Bodily temperature would come in like your whole body was twisted in some funny way and you just untwisted and the torso and legs and arms would all start feeling again.Â  Finally there was the slow roll in of bodily alerts. Around five minutes of being in some time little urges would emerge, some strictly functional, bathroom, hunger, thirst, and alertness, others were of the social and primal in nature. Realising a sudden need to pee is uncomfortable but not shocking. The arrival of imploding embarrassment or ravenous infatuation or unfettered jump up and down excitement was like your inner being being pulled around in a headlock. Probably the most strange thing about moving from one moment to some well remembered point was how it took no energy at all, it was like falling asleep, but not being tired just closing your eyes and smelling something nice, then opening your eyes and seeing the nice thing.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael had just gotten back from a beach trip the summer of senior year in high school. The anchor was a hot handrail and the smell of salt and wet towels. He sat up in his dorm, blinking fading from sunburn and flip flops to sweat pants and the faint rumble of pens on the desk. He reached over and flipped the metal switch powering down the cognition wire. He hadnât been gone for a few hours and he thought he might make another trip that night. He stretched and stood up carefully and walked over to the cork board. There was a picture from the beach, he was grinning red faced and Ellory was laughing holding a vanilla ice cream cone in one hand and a putt putt club in the other. He smiled, it would only take a day or two for the memory of that time to wash in.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael carefully opened a box of frozen sausage biscuits and plugged in a microwave that shared an outlet with his speakers. He waited two minutes after his food had heated to be sure he could feel heat before reaching in and devouring his biscuit. Right before he finished he had two emotions raise their hands, one was an intense need to pee, the other was a sense of having misplaced something. Michaelâs eyes darted from one side to the other scanning his desk and mattress, after a few moments of cross legged searching he went to the bathroom and decided to just make a note and do some more travelling. âFind something or remember to searchâ He wrote on a sticky note and pasted it on his laptop. He looked at his list and placed another check mark beside âa person to travel withâ. Scanning down the list there were only two items with no check and a few with only one. Time for âsomeone for the first day of schoolâ.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellory had arrived at college two days after move in due to her dad having his appendix removed. He knew she would probably look for him but last first days of school he didnât know her. âAnchor?â He thought laying back and flipping the metal switch. The speakers whirred and deep sound bounced and jingled the loose things taking residence inside drawers and storage bins. âCoca-colaâ Ike thought about the strangely perfect coke he had just after the welcome dodgeball tournament the second night of school. Somehow the syrup and the carbonation played just right on the ice and he remembered feeling like he was in the right place when he took his first sip. A weird, non-empirical analysis in hindsight but it made sense at the time. Michael opened his eyes, the soda before him bubbling and fizzing just so. He rocked from one side to another and the soda spilled down his hand. Where am I? He thought as music blasting filled his ears. He was in a truck, or maybe a jeep. His legs where straddling a cooler and beside him was a grinning buffoon straddling a large tent. âAre we going camping?â Michael asked the foon, âHell yeah brotherâ said the foon holding out a hand for a high five. Michael extended an elbow and the subsequent whap made him spill more of his perfect coke on the floor. Michael after only a minute or two was overcome with the feeling he was not where he should be.Â </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The great thing about moving from here to some distinct memory is that there is time to prepare for the experience. Too often thoughts about upcoming events or pending assignments pulled Michaels mind from someplace he wanted to be. As a child Michael looked out his window and saw a flood light illuminate the brilliant underside of a great oak. âThere must be a party under there. A flurry of tables and bustling guests silently scuttling about with smiles plastered on their faces and handfuls of treats.â The trouble with seeing parties that arenât there is that the feeling of some distant happy place erodes the close happy place with longing. Fear of missing out, an oversimplification, but thatâs what his friends assured Michael he suffered from. Diagnosis is really only helpful if you donât like the disease, and Michael found the idea of celebrationâs just around the corner cheerful.

The absolute fantasy Michael lived was believing there was a party someplace and then moving to the time when he was right about the party under the lights. Better still he knew the time he was free of unaccounted celebration so his mind could rest where it was. From the ages of six to thirteen every one of Elloryâs birthdays was held at the neighborhood pool. The Eastover pool was built in the sixties and at its deepest was sixteen feet. The surrounding pool deck was so narrow that the lounge chairs sat right up against the edge and patrons danced around them, occasionally falling in. The anchor that could reliably land Michael at Elloryâs partyâs was the smell of chlorine mixed with the sound of tinnie radio pop music flung from speakers that looked like sirens. Once Michael found the memories of Elloryâs eighth and ninth birthday so indistinguishable that he found himself at both at once. The only significant deviation was that one year they did cake first and the greased watermelon second and the next they switched. Likely on account of Michael gulping water and feigning eating at the bottom of a too deep pool.

Today he would visit her Eleventh birthday and sit under the shade of the diving board. He lay down and imagined the warm pool deck and the acrid smell of the cleaning solution used in the bathroom along with some kidâs version of âdoo opâ and he opened his eyes. The world was jumbled and he was worried he was two places at once again but after a moment he felt the goggles around his eyes and emptied them of water. âWanna race?â Ellory said, peering up underneath him. Michael didnât often like to do too much until he could feel all of the things he ought to feel like pain, hunger and water in his ears. âSureâ he coughed and squeaked.

Ellory went around to her friends and cousins and did her best to recruit swimmers for her event. The cousins, who were all older, declined in the sort of tone that said they had better things to do. Jessica, who took most of her life lessons from Barbie vhs tapes was pretty sure Barbie had never swam in a race and best to avoid it just in case it was something Barbie wouldnât do. Jake agreed but only after splashing Ellory four times in the eyes. Jamie said yes only because she said yes to everything and was so shy it was unclear if she had any opinions at all.

âYou ready?â Ellory said, looking at the squad holding on the edge at the five foot swim area. Moving from one side to another swimming from here to there. Michael flopped instead of swam, Jake tried just walking fast but could barely touch. Jamie swam silently and swiftly in what appeared to be some existence from the otherwise absent individual.

âYou coming?â Ellory bragged a body length in front of Michael.

âYou better watch out, I am gonna beat you!â Michael retorted, slapping the water harder without moving forward very much at all. Jamie won by a long stretch but slunk off so it was like Ellory won.

âHowâd you get so fast?â Michael asked bobbing up and down reaching for the wall.

âI donât knowâ Ellory said sheepishly. She smiled and blew bubbles.

Michael smiled, holding to the cement ledge. âI am glad you invited me to your birthdayâ.

âI am glad you could come, my cousins have to come you know. My mom makes them. And Jamie just comes to my parties because I ask her. Jake is mean.â Ellory trailed off looking around the pool at other guests. âI am

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. stared at his friend on the ground at his feet. <em>Not my oldest friend, haha.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His friendâs eyes were impassive; his facial covering shimmered with a dull gray of boredom. J.P knew if he looked around every member of the company wore the same eyes though he did not know what color masks he would see.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That gray is textbook perfect. Damn, Dan is good. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe Dan could hide his emotions but for the rest of the company their masks covered âbarely coveredâa roiling mix of emotions: relief, anger, sadness, rage, probably some envy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was over for Porno Dan now. âDonât let me bleed til I pass out,â he said weakly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicky Glasses, the companyâs medic, looked up from where he was kneeling beside Porn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNothing else?â J.P. asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAhhh..,â Nicky said. âMaybe if we can med-evacâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan grabbed Nickyâs shoulder and tried to pull himself up. He practically spit his words into Nickyâs face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo! Itâs mine! Mine! My turn!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicky shoved Dan off of him and stood up. âFine,â he muttered and took a few steps back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JP looked at Nicky and back at Dan considering the wound. It was risky. A med-evac might be able to make it in time to save Dan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâve lost a lot of blood, Dan.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit, Sherlock.â Dan tried to claw himself into a sitting position. When that didnât work he just reached for his rifle. In his weakened state he could barely drag it to him. One of the guys started to help him but Dan took a swing at him. Blood dripped slowly out from multiple wounds every time he moved and this swing pumped more of it out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan finally managed to get his rifle up and aimed at J.P. but the end was wavering pretty badly. He could not have gotten a clean shot if his life depended on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGet me a pounder and the deltaâ J.P. said quietly. Dan visibly sighed with relief but he did not lower the gun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three men dragged an enemy combatant forward. He looked more surprised and confused than scared. <em>Idiot, </em>J.P. thought. <em>Weâre a long way from Geneva.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the men and the prisoner another man carried a short shotgun. They marched the prisoner to about 5 feet from Danâs prone form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. nodded and the soldier with the shotgun handed it to the prisoner. The prisoner looked down at it confused. He almost by habit checked the chamber but managed to restrain himself. This was not the place to see if you had live ammo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNow,â J.P. said. Dan fired his rifle at the prisoner but the shot went wide, almost hitting Nicky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHey!â Nicky said. âWatch it!â He turned to J.P. âHe canât even shoot the fucking thing straight. Let me call it in.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan fired again and then again, then a third time; each time missing the prisoner. The prisoner had grasped the game and made a dash to run away. He was crouched low to make himself a smaller target. One of the soldiers (who like everyone else had taken cover when Dan started firing) kicked at the man as he ran by knocking his feet out from under him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He screamed something at them and tried to get up. Dan cursed and tried to aim the rifle but it was really wavering now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. held up a hand. âYou sure you can do this, Dan?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan nodded though his eyes were a little unfocused. If it was going to happen it was going to need to be soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPole him,â J.P. said, pointing at the prisoner. The prisoner was trying to get up now and fighting furiously. It took a few minutes but eventually the soldiers around him managed to hold him down while another one looped a lasso at the end of a long pole around his neck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The soldiers frog marched him over to stand in front of Dan again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNeck, Dan,â J.P. said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit, Sherlock.â Dan said. He aimed as well as he could at the struggling prisoner. He pulled the trigger. The shot hit but it slammed into the prisonerâs stomach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man doubled over, his body straining against the pole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPole! Pole!â someone yelled and the men holding it dropped it like it was on fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaLD, Danâs second, stepped forward. He grabbed the prisoner in a light choke hold and held him upright. One of the soldiers loosen the lasso and slipped it off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, they would wait until the prisoner was dead and moreâ¦pliableâ¦but Dan did not have that long. So J.P. grabbed the shotgun which had fallen at the prisonerâs feet and tried to hand it to the struggling and moaning man. When he did not take in J.P. nodded and another soldier stepped forward and punched the prisoner in the stomach three times. It might leave a mark but it was explainable and a risk they would have to take.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. shoved the gun into the prisonerâs hand. The man took it weakly and J.P. slid his arm around the man, weaving it between his back and LaLDâs stomach. He managed to catch the manâs hand and force two of his finger onto the trigger. J.P. yanked the barrel of the shotgun toward Dan and pulled the prisonerâs finger backwards onto the trigger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shotgun fired, the shot blasting into Danâs bullet proof vest which stopped some but not all of the blast. It slammed him onto his back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. let the prisoner go and waved for Nicky to call it in. He walked over to Dan and knelt down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâre not my oldest friend,â he whispered. Dan did not respond. His eyes were glassy. He was gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind J.P., Nicky was calling for a medical evacuation. J.P. heard the call but only half-listened. He stared down at Dan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFull evac!â Nicky was saying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe are dispatchââ. There was a pause. âTask Unit Medic 2, we show acting Lieutenant Barthaare as status: terminated.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell, youâre fucking wrong, shit bird,â Nicky said gathering up his medical supplies and stowing them in his pack. His frantic tone did not match his slow, methodical packing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPlease confirm the Lieutenantâs status, medic.â There was another pause and Nicky walked over to Dan. He waived a small device over Danâs forehead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âStatus: terminated,â the voice on the other end of the line said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>J.P. cut in. âCaptain Juan Pablo Castello here. The acting Lieutenantâs status is confirmed, Control.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFuck you both,â Nicky said as he held up his watch and looked at it. He yawned and stretched lazily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMedic 2 has taken the liberty of noting the time, Captain and Control.â His voice dripped with sarcasm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSign off, Medic 2 and get your gear squared away,â JP said. The line beeped as Nicky tapped his neck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe have the enemy shooter,â JP said. âBut the Lieutenant got him in the stomach as they were exchanging fire.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDeath sequence noted,â the voice said in JPâs ear. âRank insignia?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTwo bar Sargent,â JP said looking over at the prisoner. The man was sagging against LaLDâs arm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a moment the voice spoke. âProceed with enemy termination. Leave the body with the Lieutenantâs for forensic analysis. Retrieval is in route. 15 minutes out.  Continue with the mission.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe will wait,â JP said. He waived for the company to get dug in for the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNegative, Captain. You are directed to continue with your mission.  Asset needs immediate extraction.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe will wait until processing is complete,â JP said slowly, carefully enunciating each word. The call would, of course, be recorded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a moment the voice responded. âSuit yourself, Captain. Restart mission in 2 hours. Control out.â The connection closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He could hear the screaming engines of the Retrieval teamâs ETract in the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5 minutes? More like 30 seconds. Probably dispatched as soon as Danâs life functions went flat. He marveled as always that Control used the same tactics, trying to catch their company in a lie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe they did not care and we just following some pre-assigned script. Still the company would stay and closely watch the Retrieval team. He would sign off on it so that it could not be changed later by a higher up. That would keep company there for most of the night and some of the morning. The AO had been cleared of unfriendlies so the Retrieval team would not feel compelled to finish up and get back to base camp. Everybody took any and every opportunity to dodge Controlâs gaze that they could.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHe wasnât my oldest friend,â said LaLD, walking up and looking down at Dan. He had just finished knifing the prisoner in the neck to kill him and also cover up any evidence of the poleâs lasso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit, Sherlock,â JP said, smiling a little behind his mask. He hoped it was not enough to slide its color towards humor. He marshaled his emotions into a bored callous disregard for everything and everyone around him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Retrieval was touching down in the clearing. JP watches the open bay doors to see if he knew the OIC. He did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââNo shit, Sherlock.â Good one. I am going to steal it.â LaLD said. His mask indicated a slight smile, too. JP did not bother tell him to rein in his humor. To anyone looking it would (mistakenly) look like a subordinate salivating over a wartime promotion. That would fit right in with what Control expected from this company of halfwits and thieves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JP knew the promotion would be exactly opposite of what LaLD wantedâthe old man hated even being a 2nd, let alone in charge of anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGet your platoon buttoned up, LaLD,â JP said. âRetrieval is here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMy plaââ LaLD stopped mid-sentence. He looked down at Danâs body. âOh.â He cursed and stomped off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Retrieval officer approached JP and saluted. JP returned the salute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âButcher shop, huh?â The officer nodded around</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel no single emotion at any time during this. For every description I feel as though there are no less than two feelings to process. I know they get family members out of the line of duty if they die the right way, but the way you describe the injured soldier denying any evac, it is a complicated human set of feelings. He doesn't want to waste the opportunity, he has a plain look on his mask, he is pragmatic and rational in a disturbing sort of way. Then the prisoner, sure he would kill them if he could, but to be used as a prop for a killing in his final moments, I feel sorry for him. I always compliment the dialogue and here it is equally deserved. What would someone say in this situation, certainly something like this, a masculine goodbye of deflection and helping a friend out one last time. This foray, the narrative is so in the middle of so many emotions, it is my opinion people view wars on a macro level. Iraq vs. US, Germany vs. Russia and so on, this plotline messes with that notion. These soldiers have motivations that are often espoused about war, defending your home, freedom of you and loved ones, but due to some litigious process they have to act within some defined set of behaviors. They act in there own interest, following perverse incentives. I think people have a romantic association with war, it is pure, struggle for freedom, liberty and pursuit of happiness. Your story kicks that, war is a nasty struggle to kill any one or do anything to destroy that which endangers your family. The enemy is the ones trying to kill you, but also those who might recruit your son, and rigid order to which you must follow. JP is great, he doesn't want to be there, he doesn't want to lead, but he will do WHATEVER it takes for his men... I could see, sometime in the not too distant future, a Carl's-Verse, oh yeah these soldiers are on the same planet Harry and Doyle once occupied.]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>He could hear the screaming engines of the Retrieval teamâs ETract in the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5 minutes? More like 30 seconds. Probably dispatched as soon as Danâs life functions went flat. He marveled as always that Control used the same tactics, trying to catch their company in a lie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe they did not care and we just following some pre-assigned script. Still the company would stay and closely watch the Retrieval team. He would sign off on it so that it could not be changed later by a higher up. That would keep company there for most of the night and some of the morning. The AO had been cleared of unfriendlies so the Retrieval team would not feel compelled to finish up and get back to base camp. Everybody took any and every opportunity to dodge Controlâs gaze that they could.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHe wasnât my oldest friend,â said LaLD, walking up and looking down at Dan. He had just finished knifing the prisoner in the neck to kill him and also cover up any evidence of the poleâs lasso.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit, Sherlock,â JP said, smiling a little behind his mask. He hoped it was not enough to slide its color towards humor. He marshaled his emotions into a bored callous disregard for everything and everyone around him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Retrieval was touching down in the clearing. JP watches the open bay doors to see if he knew the OIC. He did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââNo shit, Sherlock.â Good one. I am going to steal it.â LaLD said. His mask indicated a slight smile, too. JP did not bother tell him to rein in his humor. To anyone looking it would (mistakenly) look like a subordinate salivating over a wartime promotion. That would fit right in with what Control expected from this company of halfwits and thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JP knew the promotion would be exactly opposite of what LaLD wantedâthe old man hated even being a 2nd, let alone in charge of anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGet your platoon buttoned up, LaLD,â JP said. âRetrieval is here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMy plaââ LaLD stopped mid-sentence. He looked down at Danâs body. âOh.â He cursed and stomped off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Retrieval officer approached JP and saluted. JP returned the salute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âButcher shop, huh?â The officer nodded around</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan looked away from the pile of bills and pills on the nightstand. It was the seventh, maybe eighth time he had done his little routine this month.  Grab the pills in his fist, bring it towards his mouthâ¦and pause. Eventually, he would put them down again roughly and get out of his bed. He would walk to the window or maybe the bathroom but never would that little pile of death be completely out of his line of sight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had played this game before over the years. More frequently over the last few years. But this time felt different. The first time had ended with him violently flushing the pills down the toilet. He had stormed out of his bedroom, out of his house, and into the hot Florida sunlight with a newly found appreciation for life. He had become enlightened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But enlightenment fades over time. The failures and rejections pile up. The old ones you were hiding from poke their head up above ground. You start to lose at your Wack-A-Mole attempts to beat them back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time felt different though. His parents were safely out of town. He phone was ready to start the countdown to call Emergency Services after a few hours. All he needed to do was swallow and push a button. That way it would not be his parents (hopefully) that would find him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the pills and his demons just wouldnât shut up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan went to his bathroom and for what seemed like the millionth time he stared at the old man in the mirror looking back at him. Old, failed, purposeless, rejected. Dan practically had a PhD in rejection. Yes he had known it was part of the gig but come on! Canât a guy at least get a one break!? A little one?!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â he said to the mirror. His next words were supposed to be something like âenough of this shit, Iâm flushing the fucking pills for good this time.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But instead what came out was âplaytime is over.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan gaped at the paunchy middle-aged man across from him in shock. <em>I actually mean it,</em> he thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked back into the bedroom at the nightstand and the little pieces of death sitting on it. He knew somehow it was time to go. He just knew. And it scared the shit out of him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had not written a letter of explanation this time. âIâm a failureâ was pretty evident just looking at his life. At his room in his parentsâ house that he had never quite managed to move out of.  No explanation needed. And the only people that caredâhis parents, a bunch of friends and acquaintances at the pub, maybe an old work colleague or two âthey would not need a letter to explain what they saw every time they looked at him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quickly, before he lost his nerve, Dan raced into the bedroom and practically dove into the bed. A memory of himself as young child diving into this very bed flashed through his mind. His dad running along behind him, both of them laughing. DanâDanny actuallyâlittle Danny laughing as his daddy tickled him. The memory hurt. The look of the unconditional love of a parent in his fatherâs eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pure selfishness of what Dan was about to do flashed through his mind and he shoved all of it away. He grabbed the pills and slammed them into his mouth and mashed the button on his phone to start the Emergency Services call countdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHello, Dan. This isââ a voice said from the phone. He had already started swallowing the pills, but so many in there at once was making it difficult to get them down. He turned the phone over and looked at the caller ID, but did not recognize the phone number.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDan?â the voice said again, unsure. Dan tried to speak but a pill lodged in his throat and he started to choke. He spit everything out of his mouth, spewing it all over his comforter and hacked. The irony of him choking to death on the pills he had just decided NOT to kill himself with was not lost on him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes?â he spluttered finally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDan, itâs Elizabeth Wells,â the voice seemed a little more confident. âAre you okay? Is thisâ¦ah, not a good time?â The womanâs voice was cultured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWho is this?â he asked. <em>How many of those fucking things did I swallow?</em> âHold on!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan grabbed the phone and rushed to the bathroom. He hated vomiting with a passion but he stuck his finger down his throat and after a second he was retching. He rested his head on the edge of the toilet for a moment, trying to clear it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had dropped his phone facedown on the floor but he could vaguely hear the caller was still talking. ââ¦schoolâ¦question forâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan picked up the phone. âWhââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retched involuntarily and then coughed. âWhoââ. Another retch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs Lizzie, Dan. Jesus.  Lizzie Caresh,â the caller said and Danâs heart stopped a beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm sorry,â he said. âLiz from high school?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo, from your fucking wet dreams. Of course from high school, you asshole.â All of the affectation and put-on culture was gone from Lizzieâs voice now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan was silent, unsure what to say. âWhat do you want? Iâm sort of in the middle of something here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâre in the middle of something?â Lizzie asked like the concept of him having anything to doâof anyone having anything to doâexcept what she wanted of them was completely foreign. It probably was come to think of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âStuff,â Dan said. He knew it sounded childish but âcommitting suicideâ felt a little too personal. That thought took his eyes back to the bedroom and his nightstand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then he looked down at his phone realizing what had happened. She had called right as he had been trying to set the timer for Emergency Services and her call must have popped up and he answered it right at that exact moment. What were the odds?  Apparently pretty good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie was saying something. Instead of listening he stared at his phone. <em>Was this some sort of sign? Not to do it?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWellâ¦?â Lizzie asked. âYes or no?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?â Dan asked, putting the phone back to his ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now Lizzie sounded irritated. âDid you hear anything I just said!?!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â Dan said. âCan you start over?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie was silent for long enough that he looked down to see if she had hung up. But the callâs second counter just kept climbing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, she spoke. âYouâre going to make me beg.â It was not a question. Dan waited, unsure what to say. Her voiceâeven based on his vague memory of itâsounded strange. âWhat do you want? Money? A quick fuck? What is it going to take?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTake?â Dan asked. He had missed some crucial part of the conversation but damned if he was going to ask the girl that ruined his life (or at least started it down the path to Hell) to catch him up on what he had just woolgathered through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie spoke again and all her bravado and venom was gone. âPlease, Dan. If there was anyone else I would ask them, but it has to be you. Youâre his father.â Quickly she added: âBiological father.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danâs jaw dropped. He cocked his head. âDid you say âfatherâ?â Danâs mind reeled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAre you high?â Lizzie asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â Dan said, trying to stand. His legs were wobbly and it had nothing to do with the morningâs events so far. He stared at himself into the mirror. âI was just trying to kill myself when you called, butâ¦â he said absently. âDid you say âfatherâ, like as in âsonâ father or did you mean like âpriestâ father.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHold on,â Lizzie said. âDid you say you were trying to commââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs not important,â Dan said. He had a <em>son</em>! But how? Howâ¦. Dan did the math. High School 10 year reunion. Supply closet. Shit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThis kid is 14?â he asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie started to say something else then sighed and muttered. âYes. Fourteen.â He could hear her regret. It was fresh. Same as he saw it in her eyes as so many years ago. <em>Letâs forget this ever happened</em>, <em>Dann</em>y.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan hadâ¦a son. Images flashed through his mind. Ones he had created as fantasies back when he had dreams about being a father and a husband and successful and internationally recognized andâ¦. But nowâDan looked over at the pills again. But now everything was different. He had a son! He felt a weird rush of pride. And the usual angerâlife had stolen yet one more thing, 14 years of being a father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he had a reason to live. Finally, something not just centered around his own stupid, pointless life. What did a father do with a 14 year old? The kid would not even know him. But a biological father had a special relationship with a kid, didnât theyâespecially a son, right? Some sort of inherent bond through shared blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat weâre you saying about the only one?â Dan said suddenly, remembering her earlier words. âWhat can only I do what for him?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTake his spot, Dan,â Lizzie said. âYou can take his spot in the draft. Please, Danny. Please. Iâll do anything. Just tell me.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAnythingâ¦?â He said the word but he was not asking Lizzie for anything. He just did not know what to say at that moment. His reason to liveâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHis spot!â Dan yelled. âYou called me to fucking take a kid I never even metâs draft slot? Join that old man soldier group?â He was not angry that she wanted him to take that spot, only that she/Life had just ripped away yet another thing from himâGod, one break! Just one fucking break!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDo you know what the life expectancy is for those fucking guys?!â Dan yelled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The irony of a man who had just tried committing suicide now being scared about getting killed did not escape him. But it was one thing to have the option to pull the trigger yourself whenever you were readyâit was a totally different thing to have a guy out in the dark somewhere with a gun trying to make that choice for you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDidnât you say you were trying to kill yourself,â Lizzie said in a small, but strangely hopeful voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan exploded.  âHow dare you! How. Dare. Fucking. You. How dare you call me! Who the fuck do you think you areââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThe mother of your son,â Lizzie yelled back at him, angry now, too. âThe one that has to tell her husband oh by the way I fucked and old boyfriend accidentally but thanks for playing Daddy for 14 years.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell, boo-fucking-hoo,â Dan was gritting his teeth now. He wanted to kick something. Someone. His righteous fury faltered for a second when he looked down and noticed he was wearing his bathrobe. <em>What kind of asshole kills himself in his bathrobe?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy doesnât Mr. Wonderfulââ Dan stopped.  It was a genetic test.  Everyone knew that.  He was not going to give Lizzie the satisfaction of talking down to him. Fuck her!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHis name is Dan,â Lizzie said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou married a guy named the sameââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMy son is named Dan,â Lizzie said. âHis father doesnât know why. Now.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan stumbled on something and cursed. He had been pacing. Righteously pacing in righteous anger. The mention of the boy brought him up short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou named him after me?â Dan said. âWhere are you?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI donât know,â she said. âIn my car. Driving around. I couldnât make this call at home.â She sighed. âI think Iâm near the beach. Actually near your parentsâs house. Where do you live now?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm at my parentsâs house.â He said, then added: âHousesitting.â It was sort of true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She sighed heavily. âCool. I remember how to get there.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>She still thinks I want to fuck her.</em> Okay he had not seen her but he did want to; even without seeing her. So maybe her sigh was not completely unjustified. Dan walked in the bathroom and looked in the mirror at a middle aged man in a bathrobe with traces of vomit around his mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â he said quickly. âNot here. Um, that would beâ¦disrespectful.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie snorted. âFine. Weâll go to your place. Iâve got the draft swap papers with me.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI want to meet him,â Dan said suddenly. âMy son.  Our son.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?â Lizzie said.  âMeet him?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes,â Dan said. âWhere is he?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSchool, butââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan grabbed some clothes out of his drawers. âGood. Bust him out and meet me at Getanos in 30 minutes.â Dan lifted an arm and smelled his armpit. âAn hour,â he amended turning on the shower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âButâheâs in. HeâI canât justâ¦Danny I will not takeâ¦plus thatâs a bar!â Lizzie said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit, Sherlock,â Dan said. âOne hour. Table for two. Me and him. And give him the papers. Not you.  You fuck off to your car.  If heâs not there I walk.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lizzie was silent.  Maybe letting him process through asking her to leave her son in a bar by himself while she waited outside in the car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFine,â Dan said.  âYou can sit at the bar and drink whatever rich girls drink as their <em>mistakes</em> save their ass. And I havenât ruled out a blowjobâtwo blowjobsâat some point in the future, by the way,â Dan said and hung up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan went back into his bedroom while the water in the shower heated up. He dropped his phone on the bed and grabbed the large pile of pills on the nightstand. It was enough to kill him 10 times over. Some had fallen onto the floor and he picked those up too. He went back into the bathroom, tossed all of the pills into the toilet and flushed them. Gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then he went and grabbed every secret suicide stash in his room. In his room in his parents house. <em>What the fuck was I thinkingâ¦?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He flushed way more pills than he ever remembered buying over the years. <em>Fuck, Dan! Just fuck!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fuck. He had a son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An hour later, he stepped into the bar that had seen him through so many of the lowest points of his life. It was why he had instinctively chosen it. This was his home turf. If life was going to throw a Fuck You he would already be in the right place to deal with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He recognized Lizzie at the bar. She had a few more miles on her than the last time he saw her but she still looked amazing. A blowjob was not sounding like such a bad idea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An image flashed through his mind. She would leave her husband and they would raise the boy together. She had always loved him andâ <em>youâll be in the middle of a fucking warâ¦</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That poured cold water on his daydream. <em>Jesus! I should go in for a full fledged fuck. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That started to generate a few new daydreams but then he saw himself sitting at a table alone. No, not him, but, a, well, a damn good likeness of him as a boy. <em>Not the shitball you turned into though. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan slowly covered the distance to the table, staring at the boy the whole way, and pulled out a chair. He sat down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHi, Iâm Dan,â he said. The boy noddedâno, a teenager, not a boy and for some reason that disappointed Dan slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the waitresses came over. âYou want your usual, Danny?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYesâno! I mean yes. My usual: water.â For some reason it embarrassed him for the boyâteenager, the teenagerâto know he was here at the bar enough to have a âusualâ. She looked at him and then shrugged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou want another soda?â she asked the kid. The kid nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Is he deaf? </em>Dan wondered. <em>Actually dea</em>f <em>is when you canât hear. Heâ</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The waitress and the kid were staring at him.  She raised an eyebrow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?â Dan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFoodâ¦?â the waitress asked slowly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo, Iâmâwait,â he looked at the kid. âYou want anything?â The kid shook his head. The waitress gave the kid once over and Dan a mildly curious look then left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSoâ¦â Dan said, drumming his fingers on the table. The kid stared at him, not hostile just curious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSoâ¦?â the kid said back.  He took a drink and chewed on the ice.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crunch.  Crunch, crunch.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crunch, crunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan fought the temptation to look over his shoulder at the clockâmostly because he had nothing else to do today.  Well, actually now he did, didnât he?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhere do you go to school?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDouglas Anderson,â the kid said. He took a sip of his drink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo shit?â Dan said. âI teach there! Well, taught there. I donât now. I quit; I didnât get fired or anything.â Dan realized he was babbling and fell silent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhen?â The kid asked looking down at his ice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>If he chews that fucking ice aga</em>inâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLastâ¦two, two years back I was there,â Dan said, counting Christmases spentâwell, actually spent in this bar.  Maybe he should have ordered his real usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCan I get a beer?â the kid said suddenly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?! No!â Dan was less shocked that the kidâhis kidâasked for a beer and more shocked that the question had come right when Dan was thinking about getting a drink. <em>Maybe he just wants to seem grown up.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou ever been in a bar before?â Dan asked. The kid shook his head.&nbsp; They stared at each other uncomfortably.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The waitress brought their drinks and left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid looked over at his mother then up at the clock Dan knew was on the wall above his head.&nbsp; âSo,â the kid said. âWhat did you teach when you were teaching?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFilm: the bastard, red-headed stepchild of three departments,â Dan said a little bitterly.  <em>Kid is probably in theat</em>â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the kidâs eyes lit up. âWait....youâre the old teacher?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNot old,â Dan cringed.  âFormer.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid kept talking âYou are 'Solemn Man'?â  The kid stared at him with something like respectâ¦no, awe.  âIâve seen your work.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan sat up straighter in his chair and cocked his head slightly. âYou have?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes...,â The kid looked suddenly concerned. âNo one said--theyâre on the server. We didn't knââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan held up his hands. âItâs okay.  I just didnât thinkâ¦I just,â he took a sip of water. âI guess I thought when I left the Administration deleted them.â  Dan cleared his throat.  âI left on less thanâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His stuff was still there.  On the server.  That was proprietary.  Maybe he could sue those bastards.  Dan imagined himself standing in front of a judge.  âI just want my old job back, your honor.  For the children.  And also 10 million dollars in compensation for emotional distress.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid was saying something and Dan turned his attention back to him to listen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââ¦in order, but since you werenât there we just made up our own.â The kid sat up. âActually, now that youâre here what is the correct order?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOrder?â Dan asked. âWhat?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThe order,â the kid said, nodding. âWhat order do they go in. Your films.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan thought for a second. âWell, no order. Theyâre justâtheyâre not connected. Theyâre all standalone.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kidâs mouth dropped open. He looked down at his drink then back to Dan. His mouth worked silently then he leaned forward conspiratorially.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI promise I wonât tell anyone the order. I swear! But just me, like me to know only. Like one other person besides you, you know, in caseâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIn caseâ¦?â Dan prompted. He shot a look over a Lizzie but knew she was too far to hear their conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid looked embarrassed. âIn case, you die. Inâ¦in the war.â He sat up suddenly. âOh,â he said pulling a folded piece of paper out of his pocket. âI am supposed give you this.â He slid it across the table.  âFor you so you can, well, you know.  Mom said so you, for your daughter.  Well, anyways, thatâs it.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan picked the paper up and unfolded it, knowing what it would be. The draft transfer form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid had leaned in again. He was talking film, the gravity of the piece of paper he had given Dan completely forgotten. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââ¦is supposed to be first? And which is last?  Just first and last. I can figure the rest out on my own.â He looked up suddenly. âIâll write you at your base and tell you and write me back and tell me if Iâm right.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThatâs a lot of âwritesâ,â Dan said after a minute. It was a lame attempt at a joke but the kid at least pretended to laugh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYeah,â he said. He sighed sounding a lot like his mother.  âIâm being annoying. Sorry, I do that sometimes.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Did they have bases for Jeries?  </em>Dan wondered.  He was going to need to do a little research.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMe, too,â Dan said. âPeople say Iâm annoying too sometimes. Actually a lot of the time.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan read the form. It had his information filled in and small Post-Its where he was supposed to sign or initial. Nothing was filled out for the Child Being Temporarily Supplanted section. At the very bottom of the form it did inform Dan he would be tested at the Recruitment Center for confirmation of genetic matching. And there was some mentioned of penalties for falsifying records andâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid looked still looked crestfallen though he was trying to hide it.  He started to go after the ice again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy do you think the films are connected?â Dan asked the kid quickly, hoping to head that little torture off at the pass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a moment the kid stared at Dan like he had grown two heads. Then he smiled like he had just figured out the rules to a secret game: the Master was testing the Studentâs Resolve to be let into the secret Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He held up his hand and began ticking off reasons, counting them with his fingers. âFirst, there are 8 films: 3 shorts, 2 commercials, 1 half length, and 1 that looks like it was intended to be a trailer for a full length. Secondâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan smiled in spite of the fact that he was holding a death sentence in his hands. The kid was using a pedantic tone suitable only for late night coffee shop debates. He shot a look over at Lizzie who was on her phone. <em>Husband, probably.</em> <em>Wondering where his trophy wife and my kid are.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid was onto his third finger. ââ¦each film has a bit part walk-on character who obviously is meant to represent you. Fourthââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Bit character</em>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHold on, what bit character?â Dan asked. âCharacters,â he amended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid leaned back and smiled incredulously. He raised his counting hand then realized he was 4 fingers in on that one so he raised his other hand and counted as he rattled off eight bit characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan racked his memory trying to place each name though some were just like âthe guy at the gas station in the background watching.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan waived his hands and shook his head. âThat guy at the gas station was just some guy watching us film who got into the shot. And the girl in the second commercial wasâactually I donât even know who she was but she wasnât even a part of the script.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAh, but you put them in there. You could have left them out.  I watched all your stuff including the pre-edits.  So obviously there was a reason.â The kid was still coffee shop debating and Dan realized he was too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell, yeah, possibly but in each case as an artist Iâ¦â he stopped. âWell, maybe you have a point with the gas station guy.â The kidâs face lit up but Dan held up a hand. âBut the girl in the commercial and the, what was it, oh, yeah the car they were sitting on talking that was definitely notâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was two hours later before Dan finally conceded the eight bit characters. It had been a lively, sometimes raucous debate, but the kid had won the day. Every argument soundly trounced over a steady delivered barrage of waters and sodas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI gotta pee,â the kid said, standing up from the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm fine,â Dan said trying to salvage some of his pride. âBut before you go donât you want to hear the proper order of my films?â Dan said smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid blanched, torn between two different needs. Dan leaned back. âWhatâs it gonna be, Sherlock?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He managed to keep a straight face for all of 30 seconds before he laughed and waived the kid on. When the kid hesitated Dan said âI promise to tell you when you get back.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid gratefully spun around then stopped. âOh here,â he said and pulled a pen out of his pocket and set it on the table. Then he dashed off towards the restroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan stared down at the pen. He had gotten so caught up in the coffee shop debate with the kidâhis kid, Dan reminded himselfâthat he had forgotten the reason he was really there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slowly he opened the form. <em>No name filled in for the kid. My kid. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked down the bar (Dan had moved the discussion to the bar because who debates at a table?). Lizzie was staring at him. No, Elizabeth was staring at him. Lizzie did not exist anymore. Staring and waiting. Would he tear up the paper? Walk out while the kid was gone?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOkay,â the kid said, sliding back on his stool at the bar. Dan saw Elizabeth look down at her phone on the bar then pick it up to answer it. She stood up and walked outside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No Iâm not in a bar, baby. Weâre at the library. Iâm not with an old ex-boyfriend.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI owe you a sequence of films,â Dan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhatâs your name, kid?â Dan asked. His fingers toyed with the pen, spinning it slowly around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Signing my own death warrant,</em> Dan said to himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid looked slightly embarrassed as he realized he had talked for two hours with an adult and never once introduced himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âEverett Wells,â he said sheepishly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou got a middle name?â Dan asked staring down at the pen. The kidâ¦Everett could tell something had changed while he was gone. âChristopher,â he said slowly, a hint of curiosity in his tone.  Dan could feel the kidâs eyes on him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy?â the kid said when Dan did not saying anything else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou a âJr.â?â Dan asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â Everett said slowly. âIâm the third. Why?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âEverett Christopher Wells, III,â Dan said as if considering it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked down the bar but Elizabeth Wells must have still been outside on her call. Or maybe just hiding out there. Or maybe he was supposed to go out there and let her blow him. Dan did not remember her blowjobs being particularly earth-shattering. Definitely not âsign your own death warrantâ level stuff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan looked at Everett Christopher Wells. <em>Never will know who I am</em>, he thought. <em>Fucking Lizzie.</em> So she gets everything she wants: husband who thinks he has a faithful wife, kid who does not know what a lying bitch his mother is, and hey, probably even an inconvenient sperm donor that cannot spoil the soup because he is dead, dead, dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâre 14, right? Getting close to that draft arenât you?â Dan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few people nearby turned their heads toward him. That was about as impolite a question as you could ask in this day and age. Even in a bar full of aged losers with their âusualsâ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kidâs face drained of all color and instantly Dan felt like a complete asshole. He shoved the feeling down. Why should this kidâhis kidâget Danâs life and his death. Life or God or whatever Fates were out these had taken everything from Dan. Every opportunity was stolen away. What was it that snotty punk kid at Douglas Anderson had said to Dan? Oh yesâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou ever heard the phrase âthose that canât do, teachâ, Everett Wells the Third?â Dan asked.  Everett watched him carefully then smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âObviously!  Everybody has. You carved it into the wall of the Film Studies room.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danâs eyebrows rose, his malice gone, replaced by real curiosity. âThey left it there?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everett Christopher Wells #3 smiled widely. âNo, they sanded it, painted over it, even tried to replace the wall section but every time they did we just carved it back in.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCarvâwhy?â Dan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBecause you carved it first and your films are fucking awesome,â the kidâhis kidâsaid, like it is painfully obvious. He was looking at Dan as if he was wondering if this could be the same man who carved that graffiti in a fit of rage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBecause you carved it,â the kid said again.  He lowered his voice.  âRemember?  âFuck anybody that wants to erase you!â.  From the short. The 3rd in the sequence.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>â5th,â Dan said smiling.  The kid opened his mouth to protest but Dan held up a hand.  âFine, 3rd.â  Dan actually had no clue what line the kid was referring to but it was a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan could see the unbridled joy that the kid was hiding as he remembered their film order discussion.  No that wasnât joy that was straight up glee.  The kind you get when you have a secret weapon your enemy doesnât expect. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To have verified proof from the Creator that you were right about something.  Oh it was going to be a verbal ass-whooping given out in the Film room tomorrow to whoever had disagreed with the kidâs order sequence of the film.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo, can I?â the kid said looking up.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?â Dan asked.  He stood up from the stool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWrite to you at your base?â  The kid pulled out his smart phone out of his book bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou want to write to me?  You donât even know me,â Dan said.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell, sure, letters and you knowâ¦â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danâs mouth dropped open.  âAre you trying to get me to read your screenplays, you little shit!?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid started to protest but Dan smiled.  He ruffled the kidâs hair.  âIâm kidding.  Yeah, send them to me.  Iâll need something out there in the brush to wipe my ass with.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThen Iâll print them on sandpaper,â the kid laughed.  Then his voice dropped.  âBut will you write me and tell meâ¦what itâs like?  Over there?  So I know what to expect?  And donât bullshit me, okay?  I can handle it.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid looked so scared and it literally felt like someone was trying to rip Danâs heart of out his chest.  âHandle itâ looked like the absolute last thing the kid could do.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan put a hand on the kidâs shoulder.  âYour mom is smart.  She will figure something out.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid nodded his head and did not look a bit like he believed Dan.  He was too old to believe in fairy tales and his Mommy being able to fix everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan leaned down and stared the kid in the eyes.  âYou will never go over there,â he said slowly, enunciating each word. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Too old to believe in fairy tales but not too old to believe in his heroes.  His hero: Solemn Man.  The relief in the kidâs face was palpable.   The mystery being who had been tearing at Danâs chest stopped.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan stood up and waved for Elizabeth Wells to come over.  âSend me your screenplays. Iâll read them,â he said to the kid. âBut you gotta do something for me.â He leaned in close and whispered âwhen youâre old enough you gotta get my saying as a tattoo somewhere.  Just to piss off your mom.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid gave Dan a sly smirk. Dan had just been about say he was kidding.  <em>Why do I get the feeling there is a whole class of film students at Douglas Anderson who already have that tattoo.</em>  Maybe getting out of town was not such a bad idea after all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elizabeth arrived and Dan handed her the signed papers.  She took them, nodded and steered her sonâtheir sonâtowards the door.</p>

<p>âJaime!â he heard his son say as his mother ushered him out the door.  âYou are not going to fucking believe who I just met.  And get this, I know the ordââ.  The door closed, cutting off the sound of Everett the 3rdâs voice.</p>

<p>âProbably should settle up my outstanding tab,â Dan said to the bartender, Jo, as she walked by.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs paid,â she called back over her shoulder.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The words took a moment to process.  âSomeone paid my bar bill?â he asked as she came back by.  Dan did not know the exact amount but he knew it was probably of decent size by this point in the month.  Jo stopped, put down the beers she was carrying.  She delicately put a hand on his.  âPaid, Danny,â she said.  She picked up the beers and walked off. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan looked away, embarrassed.  âThanks,â he mumbled after her.  His eyes met those of the man a few stools down.  Bill something.  Dan had lost at darts to him a couple of times.  The eyes were hard, hostile.  Dan kept turning, taking in the whole room.  Everyoneâhis sometimes friends, his often drinking partners, really just a bunch of strangersâall were staring at him.  Some looked sad, others like Bill looked angry, a few smiled.  A couple of people looked down hurriedly when he met their eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Home turf</em>, Dan thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy, Johnny Ringo,â Dan said loudly, doing his best Doc Holiday imitation.  Everyone looked up.  âYou look like someone just walked over your grave.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solemn Manâfailed filmmaker, hero to (soon-to-be-if-not-already) tattooed wayward youth filmmakers, an unintentionally absentee deadbeat father, and generally all around prickâwalked out on his way to find someone halfway across the world to finish a job he had started earlier this morning.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I shifted my weight back and forth in between sips of coffee, I was doing my best to appear patient while checking my phone. I wanted to fulfill my hunger before arriving, I have what I consider a healthy fear of any food made in the Woodman home or any food that has been in the Woodman home. I had seen cooked chicken one morning while I was dropping off boxes, gone to lunch with Bruce and returned to see the same plate of chicken still lingering on the counter two hours later. A large man leaned over the counter and passed me my bagel with cream cheese stacked so high it looked like ice cream. I tucked the bagel into a bag and and walked towards the car while I dialed. The message had said to be there at ten, it was ten fifteen and I had a five to six minute drive still to go. No answer, he must be busy loading boxes with many of the larger items already been hauled out and loaded by the prompt friends. I backed out and drove towards his house only to be caught behind a sprinter van covered in ladders and PVC pipe. Every light between the bagel shop and my friends place, well my friends mother's place was turning yellow then red as I approached. The plumber I was following took no chances and stopped at the lights. I vigorously massaged the steering wheel, was I that friend, the one that people expect to be late, the one letting people down with my character defect of un promptitude. My phone rang as I idled at the light, Bruce, maybe he would start with 'are you coming?' or maybe ask if I needed the address.
"Hello" I said brightly. A long pause of white noise followed.
'Heeeey Coooole" Bruce slurred in a sleepy voice. Another long pause with more static as I waited for him to continue.
"I am on the way, I will be there in five minutes" I said after realizing it was my turn again.
"Mhm, what time is it?" Bruce asked with an affect that told me he was rubbing his eyes.
"Ten seventeen, did you get the truck?" I asked to dissuade my fear he had just woken up.
"Yeah just got back with it" He said, "It's a big-un, like driving a tank lol" He laughed.
"Ok great, ok, well I will see you in just a minute" I responded.
"Ook, Coole" Bruce said back to being half awake. "See you soon"
I parked in front of the neighbors house on a curve, the Woodman home was full of cars and one large truck. I knocked on the door and for a moment all was silent. I turned around and looked at the furniture being offered on the lawn. There was a large blue wooden bin that had 'achery' in colorful wood letters on it underneath a wire shelf of undiscernible type. No one was named 'Zachary' or 'achery' for that matter in the Woodman home.
"Heeyy Cooole" Bruce said again as we hugged.
"How does it feel?" I asked.
"I don't know, I just tried not to think about it for so long. It's just uhhh, all at once." Bruce said walking inside the living room. Large bags cluttered the floor of the living room surrounding a tired pale couch set. On one end of the room a small tv played black and white movies atop a chest stacked with different size boxes.
"Sugar shut up!" Bruce bellowed as I followed him trailed by a small barking chihuahua with a bulging forehead. The dog scampered into an almost empty room and crouched into crate to peer out and shake. "Sorry she is a little scared. She will stop when she gets used to you" Bruce said looking over a bin of vhs tapes with the types of covers used when a tape has been used to record from the tv. I had no intention of getting to know sugar, you only have so much emotional energy to spend and I wasn't about to invest in any of mine in sugar.
"This is most of my stuff here, except some clothes and stuff" Bruce gestured to four plastic bins, several bags of various fullness, a yellow broom and a wooden truck meant to look like it was hauling cut timber.
"Ok, how much is in your room?" I asked ready to roll up my sleeves and commence.
"Uhm just some clothes, and a chair, and nightstand and a bed" Bruce chuckled still picking through the bins on the floor.
"Well want to start packing?" I asked feeling a slow leek of motivation spilling into the crowded kitchen.
"Uhm yeah, we could do that." Bruce said making no change in movement. I took a moment to survey the garage. A large cabinet stacked with posters of comic books and figurines of Japanese characters. A laundry basket of desktop speakers and clothes hangers sat on top of a sofa with sunken cushions. To the right of the door in the garage was a large pile of styrofoam, black bags and a microwave with a broken door. "That's the trash pile" Bruce said peering through the door now rummaging through the freezer. "So it is" I said. "well want to get on and get started?"
"I am gonna eat this biscuit, I need to get some fuel and get going. So I am gonna heat it up, you want one?" Bruce said watching the biscuit toast.
"That's alright" recalling memories and observing a quarter inch layer of frost. Bruce walked in and pulled two mouse pads off of a shelf. "See these?" He said pointing to the pads printed with japanese cartoon women on them. The pads had two large mounds of foam representing on one breasts and the other a butt. Bruce laughed. Then pulled on breast wrist cushions to reveal a split from heavy use over years. He examined them closely and delicately for a moment. "Well they are trash now" He said while tossing the items onto the trash heap. He looked over his desk moving some small items from one side of the table to another. He walked over and picked a box with a gamecube up off of a paint sprayer. What do any of us look like to someone looking in? Movies show what we think people look like living their lives but most of our lives are not fit for an audience. Bruce's Dad left his mom one Tuesday morning while he was still asleep upstairs. He packed up his two brothers, but left him. In a movie they might have shown hurried packing with the brothers clad in backpacks running out of the door. Bruce just slept through it, assuming the noise to be some non life altering activity.
Bruce picked up a box and pulled out a gray plastic contraption about the size of a deck of cards.
"See this, it's a compass and a world clock I think. I don't know, something my dad got me for my birthday. He doesn't like to spend money so I have a lot of things like this cheap science toys. I wonder if it works" He opened the lid and an electronic chime sounded, the small screen shown a blinking twelve.
"Well shit, it works" Bruce said, then he tossed it onto the trash pile.]]></content:encoded>

Man child.  That is the phrase that comes to mind.  Itâs funny that Bruce is a complex character but painted up not to look like one at first.  His life is a wreck but there seems to be some unconscious subtext going on in him.  Like the compass that he expects to be just another example of a prop in his crappy childhood story yet it surprisingly works.  Still he tosses it into the trash pile.  Even when something proves that maybe we are wrong about our assumptions or memories we find it easier to toss.  

I feel bad for the narrator but am not sure if I am supposed to.  He signed up for this and could easily break off the friendship so it will be interesting to see why he doesnât.  Both why he thinks he doesnât and why he actually doesnât.  

I like the âour lives our not movies fit to be seenâ section and the discussion behind it.  We are the stars of our lives yet 99% of it is not fit for entertainment consumption.  Someone once said to me the highs and lows are unimportant because you spend 99.99% of your life in the middle.  Bruce looks like he is at the bottom but the question is âis heâ?  Maybe that is his middle.  Or even his high.  

Good opening and like I said the bit at the end with the compass is a good hook for the next chapter.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The last two paragraphs caught me off guard.  I didnât expect him to throw it away even though it technically is trash.  I wonder if it is a small revenge thing or just a complete disregard for anything useful.  

I would like to see what other gifts Bruce got from his dad.  Usually the gifts people get us tell us something about how they see us or what they want for us.  

I forgot how crazy this familyâs story isâespecially this guyâs.  Funny how he was barely awake but still driving some massive truck around.  I was wondering though why no one else was there to help or had they been there and left in frustration?  I did want to see a little more though from the narrator when he walks in an sees nothing doneâmaybe worse than nothing.  Even if you expect it itâs hard because you see your whole day going down the drain.

The father leaving one of three sons behind is really crazy though.  Canât wait to watch more of the train wreck play out/]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner did not smile much.  When he did it was the smile an assassin gave you right before they put a bullet between your eyes.  Or maybe a wolf that was busy chomping on your entrails and wanted to thank you for that great (and now last) meal you ate for lunch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner knew this so Beaner did not smile much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of all Gerries, he was the most feared by the locals around the base.  And by the other guys.  And by the officers.  And by the baseâs resident dog.  And birds.  Andâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Beanâother than the standard enemy killing any Gerrie had to doâdid not have a violent bone in his body.  To his knowledge he had never done anything to garner that type of fear.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But people were funny.  Prisoners, when the Jerries bothered to take them, might try to get the jump on other guys but no one ever tried Beaner.  Other guys who would and actually had shot a prisoner just because they looked like they <em>might</em> try to escapeâthose guys always seemed to get tested.  Beaner just looked at them and that somehow settled the matter.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it surprised him as much as anyone when the kids who hung around the base came looking for him specifically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBad Man, Bad Man.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A gaggle of them were at the outer fence.  âBad Manâ was the nickname they had given him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner approached the inner fence.  He realized belatedly that he was holding his trench knife because he had been shaving.  The kids took a few involuntary steps backwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner waited.  The kids shuffled uncomfortably.  In the distance there was the sound of automatic gun fire but neither Beaner or the kids took notice of it.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a regular occurrence.  The kids dared each other to speak to him he knew.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>I feel your pain</em>, Beaner thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beanerâs wrist comm vibrated slightly against his skin.  He touched his ear piece and subvocalized an acknowledgment then cut the line.  Another mission.  He turned to go, the kids forgotten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs a ship,â one of them said.  They practically yelled it like a war cry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner stopped.  He waited.  Beaner was efficient in everything including his movements.  No wasted energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs a pirate ship, Bad Man.  We found it.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner turned at that.  They were 100 kilometers inland and at least half that to any river.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhere?â Beaner rasped.  It sounded like a knife being dragged across a whetstone.  He always rasped because some stupid jag-off had tried to slit his throat in a fight but only managed to screw up his vocal cords.  The other Gerries had a field day with that one.  Scariest man in the world just got scarier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âRoof,â said one of the kids, stepping forward.  âIn the Arctic.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner stared at the kids, trying to workout their meaning.  <em>In</em>â¦<em>Arctic?  Roof?  </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAttic?â He rasped after a moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âRoom in roof,â another kid said, nodding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It sounded like a trap of some sort.  âWhere?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe take you,â said one of the biggest kids.  He had to be about Beanerâs third daughterâ age.  12.  Maybe 13.  Just getting his first bit of peach fuzz on his cheeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhere?â Beaner asked again.  He doubted the pirate ship bit; it was just too unique and interesting.  A detail designed pique the interest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFar,â said a little girl who was standing behind another boy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beanerâs comm went off again.  âYou want a fucking written invitation, Bean?â  That was the captain.  He did not seem to be afraid of Beaner only mildly uncomfortable.  That endeared him to Beaner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner clicked his wrist comm once.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWe have some deliveries to make, too.  West.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner grunted and cut the connection.  He looked at the kids.  If could confirm it was an ambush and word got out he would get half the company demanding to come along.  And he would have to get it sanctioned as an AO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He turned and walked back into the workshop, put a few heavy weight garbage bags into a wheeled cart and dragged it outside.  The kids were gone as he had expected they would be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the chopper, a few of the Gerries helped Beaner load his packages.  He climbed in and untied the first bag.  All of the body parts were neatly arranged and the freezer had not frostbitten where he had branded on them the unofficial Gerrie symbolâa person in a wheelchair, like on one of those handicapped hang tags, brandishing a gun.  One of the guys looked over accidentally then turned his head and threw up out of the open bay door.  A few men edged slightly farther away from Beaner and his macabre âdeliveriesâ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner re-tied the bag and took a seat nearby.  As the chopper lifted the captain spoke.  âExtraction in a hotspot.  Lots of Toms.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner stared out the window at the passing scenery like most of the guys did.  Mission, destination, weâre unimportant.  Gerries had one mission and only one: Die publicly and verifiably and take as many of the bastards with you as possibleâpreferably at the same time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWho we pulling, Cap?â asked Tiny Dancer.  âA Tom?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPilot,â the captain said.  He checked the mission pad.  âAir Force captain Samââ the captain squinted then enlarged the text.  âSamantha Long.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo Keries out and about?â Toad Sprocket asked.  He was literally as far away from Beaner as possible in such confined quarters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain shook his head.  âNearest company of Valks got lucky and need to restaff about half their head count.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keries, or Valks or in formal parlance âValkyriesâ, weâre the female equivalent of Gerries.  There for the same purpose, with the same reward and rating system.  Though telling a Kerie she was a âfemale versionâ of <em>anything</em> was dangerous.  Why âKeriesâ and not âJunesâ as in âJune and Jerryâ from the old song by Lee Smythe?   Because as one Kerie put it âBecause fuck you!â  Beaner did not care for most Keries.  As a group they seemed a bit too blood thirsty for liking.  He had seen some of their Post Office work on a Gerrie/Kerie swap week.  It wasâ¦creative.  They did not brand  a symbol on like the Gerries did to enrage the enemy and thus ensure more lively firefights.  They did not have to; no one had any problem identifying a Kerie package delivery.  The trouble came in identifying what the âpackageâ might have been while they were alive.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once they were about 20 kilometers out from the base Beaner had the other Gerries (with stronger stomachs) help him toss the âpackagesâ out of the chopper.  With any luck there would be a full scale retaliatory attack on the base in the next few weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But those had gotten less frequent the longer the Gerries operated in an area.  Success was its own enemy.  And when the gosh dang Keries came it seemed like half the bad guys in the area just got up and left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why bother doing all this nasty âpackagingâ work to enrage the enemy and draw them in (and hopefully make them murderous)?  Still at leaset the bad guys that stayed behind you knew were serious operators.  So maybe there was a method to the Keriesâ (clearly) madness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWeâre operating off the grid this time,â the captain said.  He got a few laughs.  It was an tired joke.  Gerries only got suicide missions over the off the grid.  In the beginning that was fine but the longer they were in country the better they got as a company.  They were having to go farther into enemy territory to get a good chance of getting killed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And also it was getting harder to find enemies to âpackage upâ for delivery.  A visiting colonel suggested picking up civilians and maybe even children to âreally send a messageâ.  That poor guy accidentally fell 100 feet from of a chopper while reviewing the area surrounding the base and landed on his own trench knife.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pistol Pete circled around to pick up the colonelâon the off chance he survived the fall.  But accidentally unloaded a few hundred rounds of 50 caliber into the area where he fell.  And the guyâs staff was so distraught they kicked the crap out of themselves when they got back to the base.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasnât good to mention children to Gerries.  Especially not hurting them.  Top Brass didnât  come out to visit much anymore.  Accidents could happen to anyone at any time out here.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain nodded at the bag.  âGot enough.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bean considered the bag.  âDepends on how far.â  The captain nodded, satisfied.  Beaner knew the captain was checking on his mental state.  If a guy ever started enjoying âpackagingâ work it was time to pull him off it.  Bean still hid in the bathroom and cried for hours after every pack out.  Back home Tom Coffee was a small butcher trying to hold onto a small family-owned meat shop.  Over here he was the âBeaner the Bad Man.â  Tom Coffee could not afford to get injured he had to die.  He would never go home again after what he had become.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNeighborhood kids said they found a pirate ship,â Beaner said.  Everyone in the cabin looked up shock.  That was more words than Beaner spoke in a day.  And not in response to something.  The captain had used up most of them up already with their earlier conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDid you say a pirate ship?â Porno asked.  Beaner nodded once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSounds like an ambush,â Pretty Pete said.  Beaner looked out the open bay door.  He knew that right now his teammates were looking at each other like wolves.  Who would get to go and get a chance to end this madness?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain touched his ear piece.  âWeâre here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone looked out the window and mentally prepared themselves.  KIA, not injured and definitely not knocked out and captured.  Porno flipped on his camera and verified the feed was active.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasnât hard to see where the pilot went down.  Her plane had left a giant swath of jet parts and burning fuel.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou sure sheâs alive down there?â Porno asked.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain shrugged.  âShe was when she called for a pickup.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beast stood up suddenly and aimed the M-60 that was resting in the bay door stand.  He began firing.  There were bad guys out searching for the pilot.  Everyone sprang into action.  Some aiming out the bay door looking for and finding targets, a few guys freeing up drop lines in case the team needed to drop in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The M-60s in the other two choppers opened up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTake a fire team and check out the âpirate shipâ tomorrow,â the captain said while he paused to reload, getting ready for the rush out once they touched down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner nodded once.  That had been broadcast on the team channel.  Beaner would have a lot of âfriendsâ tonight.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every Gerrie on the team would put aside their fear and discomfort for the chance to walk into a legitimate ambush.  Great opportunity to up your body count and pad your reserve of Double Ds (Delay Days) in case you got injured and needed some recovery time before you were re-cleared for field duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner as the companyâs delivery guy had at least 3 years of DDs accrued.  He got a percentage of every bad guy he packed out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A flare went up in the distance and turned in a green column of smoke as it fell.  The pilot had seen the Gerrie choppers and just pointed a big arrow at herself for the Gerries.  But also the bad guys.  The race was on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pistol Pete veered towards the smoke column and everyone stopped firing.  Until they could see the downed pilot any moving object could be her.  Beaner marveled again at how efficient his company had become.  On their first mission they had accidentally shot the extraction target thinking it was a bad guy.  Nerves and inexperience.  The Gerries had neither now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLetâs rock and roll,â Pistol Pete said over the group comm.  Masks went on. Guns were reloaded.  The chopper touched down. Hell came pouring out of it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint was literally the oldest Gerrie in the company.  And that was saying something. And no one expected him to make it past Basicâeven the rest of the Gerries.  But when he burned through the physical and broke the submersion time record the Gerries changed their stance.  The drills and Top Brass were not sold but that did not matter; once the Gerries took a guy in he would pass.  When one guy was struggling the Drills got distracted by another guyâs hijinks.  Every Gerrie had scars on his back where he had held up the barbed wire so another guy could get under it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Clint had not needed the help.  He could endure anything.  He could run all day.  He could tread water.  He could stand on a log while everyone else dropped off or fell off from exhaustion.  For a while Clint mostly kept to himselfâuntil they came across the grave stones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were halfway through a 20 miler under about 60 lbs of weight when they passed a row of old gravestones.  Clint stopped and nearly tripped three guys behind him.  He turned off the trail and walked over to the stones and stood in front of them.   That one was too hard to cover.  The Drills were all over him in a second.  The Gerries typically squared away their own so any cracks in the group the Drills jumped on with a vengeance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint ended up carrying two packs then and the Drills drug them up and down the hills until early in the morning.  Even Clintâs legendary endurance was flagging slightly when they stumbled into the barracks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That ruck was enough.  There were only a few hours until sunrise and they knew the Drills would be on them with a vengeance at first light.  Might as well stay up.  An hour or two of sleep would almost be worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âClint,â Porno Dan said.  âWhatâs with the gravestones?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint heard the underlying question.  <em>Why did you drag the rest of us into this shit?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIt is kind of a long story,â Clint replied.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGood,â Porno Dan said.  âI need something to keep me awake.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI hear you always need something to keep you up, Dan,â LaLD said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That got a laugh.  Clint did not know LaLD well but he liked him.  The small, stocky man was quick with a joke and could take a razzing with out an ounce of injured pride.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was not just Dan who sat down though.  The entire platoon gathered around.  Some guys talked a lot so you listened rarely.  The guys who spoke very little you listened to carefully when they did.  Especially if you were going to go to war with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOk,â Clint said.  He was more of a loner but he could recognize when he had put other people in a bad situation.  And he had been in the unit long enough to know he would come to heavily depend on these men even more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMy wife passed about ten years ago.  Suddenly.  And I guess I sort of gave up for a while.  Ruined some relationships.â  There were nods of acknowledgment from some of the other men.  It was not an in common enough story, especially not in this room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint stared down at his desk.  Things had accumulated there in his absence.  Or maybe they had always been there.  He tried to organize them mentally, but they seemed to swim in front of his eyes.  Clint realized he has been standing over his desk since he arrived at the office, he had not even taken off his coat or sat in his chair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked up to see his boss standing in the doorway.  Clint fought the urge to look down at his watch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âEarly lunch?â his boss asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo.  Thanks, Dale.  I have a lot to get up to speed on.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSure, sure, Clint,â his boss said.  He stepped out then paused in the doorway.  âWhy donât you drop by my office on your way out today.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint and his boss stared at each other for a moment.  âSure, Dale,â Clint said.  Dale smiled and stepped out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A month ago Dale had been âso happyâ to have Clint back.  Every week that passed though he seemed a little less happy.  Clint had thought he had been ready to come back.  Most days though he looked up to find the office dark and just his light on.  No one thought that was strange ole Clint had always been a bit of a workaholic.  But Clint was not actually doing anything except taking up space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He needed a coffee.  Maybe visit Greta.  There was a shop just down the road from the cemetery.  An hour tops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gretaâs grave was clean.  She was buried in her family plot.  His spot was to be on top of her.  Whenever he died they would dig up some space above her and bury him with their coffins touching.  He had joked that he would have them bury him face down over her.  She had joked back that he had better make sure she died first then because she would have them both buried face down and her on top.  <em>Ha ha ha.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint knew he needed to go back soon to get fired.  It was the right thing to do.  He had not done any serious work since he had been back at the office.  Answered month-old emails that were now irrelevant.  Attended meetings where his only contribution was to sample some of the donuts. That was a change; he used to be a commanding presence in meetings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had not considered a month ago the possibility that the whole thing would seem soâ¦arbitrary.  Every day though he took his lunch down to Greta and ate there, sitting beside her, his back leaning against her gravestone.  The first few times he had gone back to the office with grass stains on his ass.  That probably shocked a few people.  Clint was always impeccably dressed.  Or had been.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sighing, Clint stood up.  He checked Greta grave and gravestone.  Now that was what he kept âimpeccably dressedâ.  It was immaculate.  His phone and he answered it automatically.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âClint Drummond,â he said.  He checked the the tree above Greta.  None of the leaves looked ready to fall.  Still he might give it a shake before he left so he could grab and loose ones that might come down in the middle of the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI have been trying to reach someone for a few weeks now,â the caller said, a man.  He sounded irritated.  He also sounded a little stoned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWeâveâIâve been busy.  Who did you say this was?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man sighed exasperated.  âDo you want the bike or not, man?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Bike?</em>  âGretaâs bikeâ¦?â Greta was an avid cyclist.  Clint was not.  Too many client meetings and power lunches combined with lack of anything resembling exercise had left Clint with a bit of a middle-aged âDadâ body. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other end of the line the man was looking at something, probably his register screen.  âNoâ¦uhâ¦nope, manâs bike.  Cross-country.  City slicker tires.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAâfuck!â Clint yelled.  He had been walking, not paying close attention and he had veered off the grass path and tripped over a half-sunken gravestone.  âSorry,â he said.  âHold on.  Fuck! Fuck!  Fucking fuck!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âUhhâ¦â the man said.  âUh, you okay, man?  I can call back later.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â Clint said, rubbing at his shin with his free hand.  âNo, I tripped over a fucking sunken gravestone.  Forget about it.  Look whereâs your store.  Iâll come get the bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs already paid for,â the man said.  He sounded wary about Clint coming by.  Clint could not blame him.  Right now Clint knew he sounded like a crazy person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint looked down at the gravestone.  The sad, little thing had been there a long time: the engraving was faded with age, moss had half covered it and the name was hard to make out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But not the age: ten years old.  <em>1878 to 188.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat are your hours?â  Clint looked at his watch.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWeâre open til 6,â the man said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOkay, thanks,â Clint said and disconnected the call.  He looked around.  He had wandered into an older section of the cemetery.  A lot of the gravestones needed some form of repair.  Clint knelt down and used his suit jacketâs sleeve to wipe away some of the moss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThatâs better, isnât it,â He said after a few minutes.  âRebecca,â he said, tracing the girlâs name with his fingers, trying to peel out some of the gunk that had accumulated over time.  The gravestone was still half-sunken so he pulled up on it.  It wiggled slightly but nothing more than that.  Clint wrapped his arms around it and heaved with his legs.  The stone moved slightly and Clint strained harder.  It seemed he had gotten weak as well as fat.  Clint got on his knees for leverage and pulled left then right trying to get it free.  The stone moved, then moved again.  Slowly, Clint worked it out of the ground.  It was longer than he expected and buried deep.  He laid it down carefully on the grass and then went looking for some loose dirt.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He got lucky and found a pile near the back fence but no shovel so he scooped it and carried it in his hands.  It took about twelve trips but eventually he had the gravestoneâs hole packed down to his satisfaction.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He carefully inserted the stone and packed dirt around it.  A few more trips to the dirt pile and the stone was secured.  Clint sat back, exhausted and checked his watch.  It was close to 3pm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bike shop was called the Rusty Sprocket.  It was tucked away in a small, dying strip mall.  Leaves had collected into crux of its L-shape.  Traffic had been worse than expected; it was 5pm.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Clint opened the door he was greeted by the some music that was popular about 20 years ago.  The kid behind the counter looked like he had been born when this music came out.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm Clint Drummond,â Clint said.  âIââ </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint stopped when he realized the guy was staring at his clothes.  He looked down and realized what the kid was staring at.  Clintâs designer suit jacket was ripped and dirty.  His expensive pants had dirt caked on the knees and his hands looked like, well, like Clint had been digging in dirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shrugged and walked toward the sales counter.  He watched the kidâs eyes flick towards the back door.  Maybe he was verifying he had a clear path to an exit in case Clint turned out to be as crazy as he looked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI spoke to someone about a bike,â he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat was me,â the kid said.  But he wasnât a kid.  As Clint got closer he realized the guy was an older man, maybe 10 years younger than Clint but he was dressed likeâand looked to be in as good a shape asâa twenty-something year old kid. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the man was a picture of a giant mountain and a second shot a cyclist on a bike with thin looking tires.  He was hunched over the bikeâs handle bars climbing up was looked to be a 40 degree slope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat you?â Clint asked, impressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man looked over his shoulder then turned back.  He smiled slightly.  âA younger, dumber version filled with more piss and vinegar.â  Clint smiled and looked around.  The shop was small but clean.  There were posters on the wall advertising various brands of bikes and a few pegboards with tools for sale hanging on them.  Clint could see what looked to be a workshop in the back, behind a partially closed door with a sign that read âEmployees and women with tight asses only.â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man cocked his head slightly.  âYou said you were at a graveyard?â  Clint nodded.  He stepped toward the bike tools.  So many gadgets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The manâs voice was somber, slightly hushed.  âAnd youâre Gretaâs husband?â  Clint nodded again tightly.  âIâm sorry,â the man said.  It was half a statement, half a question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âShe liked cycling for sure,â Clint said by way of acknowledgement to a question he did not want to answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man sighed heavily.  âWell, cycling liked her back,â he said.  The man pointed at a wall with pictures on it and a small poster on 8x11 cardstock.  Clint moved closer and examined the pictures.  There were about a dozen pictures with Greta and various other cyclists.  The poster read: âCycling For Charity: You Can Make A Difference!â  Clint read through it; something to do with getting kids out of the inner city and into cycling.  There was a picture of Greta on it.  One that he had not seen before.  A recent one.  He traced it with his finger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCould I, do you, do you have a copy of this poster I can have,â Clint asked.  âOr I can pay you to replace this one.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man stood up.  âI can do you one better.â  He reached up to a shelf behind the counter and retrieved a book from it.  He put it on the counter and opened it.  He flipped a few pages until he found one with a pictureâGretaâs picture in it. It was the one from the cardstock poster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âShe gave us that to make up the poster,â he said, handing the photo to Clint.  âI put here so I wouldnât forâ¦â the man looked uncomfortable suddenly.  âWell, for when she came back for your bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThank you,â Clint said and meant it.  âIt was like finding some strange treasure.  This photo of Greta.  It was recent.  It was one he did not know existed and for some reason that meant the world to him right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clintâs looked down and noticed the book the photo had been stored in.  It was earmarked and notations had been made in it.  The man turned the book around so Clint could see it better.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint turned a few pages.  It was a road atlas but someone had gone through manually and made it specific to cyclists.  Lists of bike repair shops and places that were friendly to camping cyclists had been circled or noted.  None of it was in Gretaâs handwriting though.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs a road atlas for cyclists,â Clint said.  The man leaned forward and turned a few pages to the next section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat is more of a guide.  This,â he said, pointing a finger at a map at the start of the section, âis where the book really starts.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint turned a few pages; all maps but none of them marked up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThe adventure begins,â Clint said dryly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man turned a few more pages and there was actually a small notation in the margin.  Clint leaned in closer.  It was a road near here; not far from his and Gretaâs house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From his house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man closed the book and pushed it towards Clint.  âShe was going to buy it.  You should have it.  On the house.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint looked at the book and then pushed it back to the man.  âThank you, but it should go to someone who will get some use out of it.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man shrugged and replaced the book back on the shelf.  âWhat about the bikes?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pointed at the flyer.  âDonate it that.  Itâs what she would have wanted.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man stared at Clint.  âMaybe,â he said but he shrugged again.  âIâll take her bike but not yours.  No kid can ride that beast.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint felt that the man was lying but was not sure how to respond.  âWhat am I supposed to do with it?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man shrugged again.  It was starting to annoy Clint that shrug.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWeâll, I have no way to take it now.  I will come back for itâ¦Tuesday.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint turned to leave but turned back.  âDo you possibly have a wire bristled brush and some sort of cleaner?  And rags?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man nodded and went into the back.  While he was gone Clint looked at the posters hanging around the shop.  As expected, everything was cycling-related or actual pictures of what he assumed were famous cyclists achieving some cycling gear of endurance or strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man returned with the requested supplies.  He handed this to Clint.  âYou can return them Tuesday,â he said as he walked back around the counter and sat down.  âWhen you come for the bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI can pay you forââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âTuesday,â the man said and turned back to his screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint left.  Back in his car he stared at the supplies on the seat beside him.  <em>What did I want with those?</em>  The thought had come to him like a whim.  He was asking for them before he knew he was doing it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day Clint did not bother to go into the office.  He knew what conversation with Dale was waiting for him there.  He drove instead to get his morning coffee and then over to the cemetery to visit Gretaâs grave.  As he was walking the path to her grave he saw the entrance path to the older section of the cemetery where all the rundown graves had been.  He paused then walked on.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As he expected the damn leaves had started to fall and some were covering the grave.  He spent a few minutes cleaning them up and then looked down at the supplies he had brought from the cycle shop.  He scrubbed at Gretaâs gravestone for about an hour getting it clean of any gunk that might have gotten into the carved lettering and wiped the stone.  He had brought some cleaner from home but for some odd reason spit and elbow grease seemed to work the best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually he sat back and checked the gravestone, looking for any imperfection.  There were none.  He started to talk to Greta about work and the office but found that he could not save the meeting with Dale he had skipped out on.  He sat for a few minutes listening to the wind.  The tree swayed slightly beside him as the stronger gusts hit it.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI went to your bicycle shop,â he said eventually.  âI saw your book.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI donât want the bike though, Greta.â  Clint said standing up.  âIt was a nice gesture.  Really.  It was.  But I am so out of shape I probably couldnât make it up the hill of our driveway.â  He chuckled.  Then said softly, âRemember we were BOTH supposed to grow old and fat together.â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint gathered his things and said his goodbyes.  He was not lying about being out of shape.  The short hour of scrubbing Gretaâs gravestone still had him breathing hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He noticed the entranceway to the older section of the cemetery as he passed it.  Suddenly with all his might he chucked the wire-bristle brush down it and tossed the rags after it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His bikeâthe âbeastââshould more than cover the cost of a used brush and some rags.  <em>Screw that guy! Screw Dale!  Screw the whole damn world!</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A reflection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparation, an important element to any family vacation, and one that many believe should be had in abundance. It makes car turn arounds less frequent and generally instills a sense of calming certainty. Will we have our bedding to sleep on? Yes. Will we have food to eat? Yes. Once the details have been arranged then the participants get down to the important business of enjoying the trip.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had vacationed with the Woodmans before, and I was at this time welcomed past the facade familys put on for friends and got to enjoy the authentic experience. I had become invisible.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I arrived at their home, I knocked and got waved inside by a figure obscured by the decorative glass of the front door. I lugged my suitcase over the door frame and stepped in. The figure had run off and I waited by the front of the house making eye contact with Tucker, a shaking Chihuahua mix anchored to the closet door by his leash. He smelled bad and he positioned himself as close as he could to me, staring up with bulbous eyes. His range of motion was not more than three feet and he radiated a strange energy of fear and business. His breathing was rapid and he wasnt the sort of dog you could talk to so I decided to go inside and sit down. Bruce came down the stairs excited to see me and I was excited to see him. We went up to the bonus room where Bruce showed me a catalog he had put together for the game Pikman. It was detailed and organized with tabs so certain elements could be referenced quickly.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Aaaron" misses Woodman called from the kitchen. Bruce immediately followed by imitating his mother. And Bruce's brother David echoed again from down the hall. This was like one of those chain restaurants that welcome guests with the same phrase, it was practiced and instinctive. Again misses Woodman called, it was strange to me because she hadn't gone to look for him or make any move to get closer so he could hear and the call was made in the same way and at the same volume. Again Bruce and David echoed. Aaron had been upset, and yelled back "What!" from his room. "I need you to help me pack the food honey." She called back. Aaron slammed his door. Bruce told me to come on and we went downstairs to take the task for ourselves. He did this frequently and I think he enjoyed being helpful. Miss Woodman was flipping pancakes and greeted me as I walked in the door. She was about five foot two with curly brown hair down to her shoulders and on that day was wearing spandex pants and an American flag t shirt with a teddy bear.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Are ya getting excited for the beach?" She asked.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"I sure am, thanks for inviting me." I said.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Of course, we are excited you are coming with us." She said holding a pancake up inspecting it. Bruce went to the closet and pulled out a gallon ziplock bag and held it open for his mother. She tossed six small pancakes into the bag. Sometime in mid teenage hood children experience family culture outside their own. Sure different people make up different families but doesn't everyone pack pancake mix and make the pancakes the day they are eaten? Bruce senior came in and said hello and asked if I was excited. I told him I was. Bruce senior was about six foot tall, thin muscular and had sandy brown hair. He spoke slow and close.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">David, Aaaron! Janet called out, 'come on down sweety'. David came down with his bag and carried it out to the garage. Aaron came down a minute later, he had been crying about something and was all red in the face. Bruce senior looked around the room and grabbed Aaron and David's hand. I linked up with Bruce and Janet and we bowed our heads. "Dear lord" Bruce senior said slowly with some pause in between. " Keep us safe as we travel and help us see the beauty of your creation. Amen" Amen said Janet.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We piled into the van, Bruce and myself got the captains chairs and David and Aaron piled into the back seats with Tucker. We played Gameboy advance for some time together but then I got car sick and had to stop. Behind us was a pop up camper, packed with sleeping bags and a tent Bruce and I were to share.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet and Bruce listened to prairie home companion on audio tape, it made me feel drowsy. Bruce and I had talked about the possibility of meeting girls at the beach. He told me the previous year he met a girl he really liked and they hung out every day. "Do you think she will be there this year?" I asked. "I don't know" Bruce said considering. Family vacations are rife with potential for discomfort, new surroundings inability to bring all the comforts of home, huge change in the schedule. But I think discomfort make us see and feel more, which helps make pungent memories. And I was there in the van with Bruce seeing the road before us, feeling uncertain about girls, hearing the droll life of early Americans, smelling Tucker and looking forward to the taste of pancakes from a bag.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the damn guy just kept calling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a month, Clint ignored a lot of voice messages and phone calls.  Every email went straight the recycle bin.  He even ignored the bills but Greta had set up all of that to auto draft or hit a credit card and then those to autopay so it was more of a screaming-at-the-storm gesture.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His office called; Daleâs admin a couple of times, Dale once, HR, coworkers, even the mailroom guy called once for something.  Clint ignored them.  Relatives, well-wishers, sympathizers, people, people, people called called called.  They eventually all gave up.  Clint suspected in his towering pile of mail was his termination letter.  Maybe a nice goodbye card.  Or get well soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that damn bike shop guy just kept calling.  Every other day to the point where Clint did not even bother listening; he just deleted the messages along with all of the others until it was just that guy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint had not crossed the threshold of his front door in a month as well.  So it kind of shocked him when he heard the knock.  He was binge watching TV in his robe and underwear.  Somewhere he had dug up a pair of slippers.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first, he ignored whoever it was.  Most likely a delivery guy or someone selling something.  <em>Maybe I should get a dog.  </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The knock came again.  And again.  It went on like that for twenty minutes.  Knock, wait a minute, knock.  Rinse and repeat.  Finally, Clint gave in.  The Golden Girls TV show he was on seemed slightly familiar anyways which meant he had probably binged it at least once before.  No way that was a delivery guy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint peered out the window.  It was the guy from the bike store.  Clintâs fists balled in fury.  He grabbed the door and yanked it open, forgetting he had set the alarm.  The guy was just about to knock again and looked both horrified and confused when simultaneously the door disappeared from under his pounding fist, the alarm went off like a banshee and Clint appeared in the doorway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat!?!!â he yelled over the alarm to the guy.  âWhat what what what what?  What?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guy took a step back and then another.  He held us his hands.  âYour alarm is going off.â  He pointed into Clintâs house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWait here!â Clint yelled and slammed the door.  He stormed over to the alarm panel and disarmed it.  Then he stormed back over to the door and yanked it open again.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWell?â he demanded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guy looked him up and down.  âI just came for my tools.  My bristle brush andââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat?!â Clint yelled.  âAre youâare you, are you serious?  You drove out here for a damn brush?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs a good brush,â the guy said. When Clint scowled he said âIâm a small businessman.  And I brought your bike.â  He gestured to Clintâs left.  Clint looked out of the doorway and saw âthe beastâ,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI told youââ Clint realized he was yelling which was fine, but he was getting a migraine, which was not.  âLook I told you I donât want the bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man shook his head.  âI left you like 1,000 voicemails.  I told you last week I was going to drop it off here if you didnât come for it.  And I need my stuff back.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint rubbed at his temples.  âTheyâre at the cemetery.  Where Greta is buried,â he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy?â the man asked with genuine curiosity.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBecause I was cleaning Gretaâs gravestone.â  Clint was tired.  He has been sleeping a lot lately but he was suddenly dead on his feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIt needed to be scrubbedâ¦â The man asked.  He looked left and right taking in the giant mansion in front of him, âalready?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo,â Clint said.  âWell, yes.  Dirt and grime can ruin those things quickly.  Theyâre wide open to the elementsââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhich is why theyâre stone,â the man said slowly.  âSort of the point, right, of using stone?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Clint just looked away the man asked, âWhen are you going to get them?   I canât come back over to this side of town until next Tuesday.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A small part of Clintâs brain asked him if he <em>was</em> going back.  Another part though, wondered why they had not been back in so long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI donât actually know where they are,â Clint said.  âI, sort of, threw themâ¦into another part of the cemetery.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The manâs jaw dropped open.  âWhyâ¦?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint realized he had no earthly idea why.  âI have no earthly iââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âButâ¦why?â The man interrupted.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI was angry?â Clint said, though it came more as a question.  He felt like he was 14 and had just been caught smoking.  âLook just keep the bike,â he said, gesturing at âthe beastâ resting forlornly against one of the columns in front of the house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI donâtâI donât want your bike, I need my brush,â the man said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat bike has got to be worthâis this like some special brush or something?â Clint said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of responding the man just looked at Clint.  Then he looked left and right again taking it the giant house.  Then he looked somewhat sadly down at the bike.  Clint could practically read his thoughts.  <em>Rich guy, doesnât care about anyoneâs stuff.  Thinks he can buy the world.  What did Greta see in him? </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint was not exactly sure he knew the answer to that question at this moment.  âI can get it back,â he said weakly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man managed to combine sarcasm and disbelief into a very convincing and chastising look.  <em>Actually</em>, Clint thought, <em>I feel</em> <em>about 6 years old right about now</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man just shook his head and turned around.  He began to walk up the driveway. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHey! The bike,â Clint yelled after him.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs paid for,â the man yelled over his shoulder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint stared helplessly after the man.  He looked down at the beast.  âDid you ride this here?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThereâs trails,â the man yelled and then he was gone, around the bend of the driveway leading up to the street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWait!â Clint called.  âTake the damn bike!â  He grabbed it and tried to wheel it after the man.  âHey come back here!  Hey!  Hey!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint made it halfway up the hill before he could not run-push the bike any further.  He dropped it and ran after the man; his lungs and heart felt like they were trying to pound their way right out of his chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he reached the top of the driveway he found the man assembling something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint doubled over, trying to catch his breath. âWhaââ Wheeze, âWhat areââ Wheeze.  âWhat are you doing?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man looked up in surprise; though, Clint was not sure if it was because a man in a bathrobe was chasing him or if because a man in a bathrobe was about to have a heart attack in front of him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint wheezed and hacked for a solid minute before he was able to stand up and speak.  âWhatâs, whatâs that?â He said, pointing at the steel frame the man was screwing something into.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man stood up and held it up.  âBackpack bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint could see that it was miniature, foldable steel bike.  By the way the man was lifting it it seemed extremely light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYouâre going to ride that thing across town?â Clint asked.  He heart was still trying to rip free from his chest but his lungs at least were finally cooperating and sucking in glorious, life-restoring air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man had finished assembling the portable bike. He eyed it critically.  âNo, thereâs a bus stop about 3 miles down the main drag from here.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThere is?â Clint asked, surprised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man just rolled his eyes, got on his bike and peddled off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIâm going to get your brush,â Clint yelled at the manâs retreating back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man flipped him a rude hand signal and then turned the corner and was gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gretaâs gravestone was in good shape but the plot had gotten covered with leaves.  It took Clint about 20 minutes to get them picked up and tossed far enough away that the wind would not just blow them back onto the plot.  He scowled up at the nearby tree who was clearly the culprit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSorry it took me so long to get back, baby,â he said to the gravestone. âI was busy falling apart and binge watching Golden Girls re-runsâ seemed a bit trite so Clint did not mention that part.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Clint had left that morning he almost ran over the damn âbeastâ bike.  Yesterday he had let it lay where he dropped it on the driveway.  He barely managed to stop his car  in time.  He had loaded the stupid thing into the backseat as best he could.  He would go see Greta, get the bike shop guyâs tool and return them and the damn bike.  And maybe he would pop the arrogant ass in the mouth for good measure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI will be back tomorrow,â he told Greta.  âI promise.  No more screw offs and pity parties.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint found the brush and rags not far from the entrance to the old section of the cemetery.  For some reason that pissed him off more than if he had not been able to find them.  They were clearly visible if you took a few steps down the path.  Which meant no one had been down here in a month.  Where the Hell was Maintenance?  Was some fill dirt and a headstone all that the outrageously expensive plot fee got a person?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He paid a visit to the gravestone he had rescued and noted with some absurd sense of joy that it had not sunk again.  But seeing the other graves in the early morning light quickly depressed him.  They were in terrible shape; dirty, moss-covered, sinking, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint had been holed up in his damn house for a month.  He was tired of forgetting things.  He wasâto be honestâtired of hiding from the pain of his life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By lunch time Clint had cleaned the first row of gravestones beside the one he had rescued a month back.  It was grueling work, detailed and delicate because as he quickly realized stone lasted a long time, inscriptions were less hardy.  He ate his lunch leaning his back against Gretaâs gravestone.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then he laid down on her plot and wept silently like he did every time it was time to head home.  Just a few feet of dirt and whatever distance it was to where people went when they died.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually he drug himself to his feet, fixed the grass where he had flattened it and said his goodbyes.  When he got to his car he opened the back door to toss in the brush and cleaning supplies only to realize the beast was packed in there taking up much of the space.  He could get the stuff in there but if anything fell he would have a Hell of a time digging it out around that damn bike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He stared at the bike and then some reason he reached into the car and wrestled it out onto the parking lot.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMaybe I should trade you to one of the maintenance guys for a promise of cleaning up the older section of the cemetery.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead Clint locked his car, pocketed the keys and got on the bike.  He was maybe 3 miles from his house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint did not have a heart attack on the way home.  He did not get hit by any cars.  He did not stop 5 times to restâonly 4.  Clint did however discover that bike seats were extremely uncomfortable (were there such things as butt callouses?) and that bikes went really fast when you peddled as hard as you could.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latter discovery was an accident.  His tender ass had demanded he stand or do something that did not involve sitting.  So he had stood up slightly on the pedals and crouched forward over the handle bars trying to maintain his balance. He had peddled as hard as he could for some reason and he had gone fastâ¦until he hit a speed bump and the bike seat had come crashing up into his nuts.  He had sort of stopped, sort of collapsed over into the grass for a few minutes.  So maybe technically he did stop 5 times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still it had been fun going that fast; like the world was rushing all around him, like he was not even a part of it, and his problems were struggling to keep pace with him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His problems caught up with him at the house when he opened the fridge and realized he was practically out of food.  The store was at least 5 miles away and his tender tush was having nothing to do with that bike tonight, that was certain.  It was completely on strike, making him walk like a bow-legged duck for revenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint made due with some buttered bread and the dregs in a bottle of crappy wine he had somehow failed to finish off during his month of âhibernationâ.  He would cycle back to the cemetery tomorrow and grab his car.  Then he would take the beast back to the bike shop and be done with the whole affair.</p>

<p>Clint paused and looked around the makeshift barracks.  Everyone was watching him and he had gotten lost in telling the story.  For a time no one had been there around him, just him, talking to Greta like he used to when the nights were long and there was nothing to do but watch the dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, no one paid much attention to him but with all the eyes fixated on his he  was nervous.  To cover it Clint sat grabbed a canteen and drank a few sips of water.  He knew they would want the rest of the story.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âAndâ¦.?â Johnny Hollywood said as if on cue.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWho came to you?â the captain asked.  âEventually.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNobody,â Clint said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYour kids,â Hollywood said.  âThey came to the house or your wifeâs grave?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shook his head.  âI donât have any children.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That hung uncomfortably in the room.  Guys looked at each other.  There were special cases like Johnny Hollywood but extremely rare.  And Johnny did have kids.  Or at least he usually said he did when he was asked.  And no one at Command ever contradicted that.  Of course, why would they?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Captain leaned back against the post he had been leaning on.  He gestured for one of the guys to secure the door and shut off the lights.  Someone produced a small lantern and handed it to Clint.  The Captain clearly wanted no interruptions for Lights Out and he was sending a clear message to Clint that the story had to be finished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint turned on the lamp.  He looked at the captain who just lounged with his arms crossed like he did not have a care in the world.  But his eyes were hard the way they got sometimes before a mission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>He just realized he never got my story out of me</em>, Clint thought.  The captain did not believe in heading into a mission with guys he did not know or trust.  Yet he had accidentally missed that Clint did not have a backstory that anyone in the company knew.  Clint knew the captain was silently kicking himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>You have a lo</em>t <em>on your mind</em>, <em>Cap,</em> Clint thought.  <em>Itâs understandable</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint took a deep breath.  His was really a stupid story; pointless to tell.  But these were his brothers now.  And family kept each otherâs secrets but not secrets from each other.  This might change everything between him and the others thoughâhis story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââ-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took Clint a week of grueling, delicate, detail-oriented work to get the old gravestones cleaned up.  And for some reason after the fourth one he had started taking etchings of them.  Then etchings and pictures.  Lately, Clint had no idea why he did some thingsâlike keep âthe beastâ and ride it everyday to the cemetery or clean these old gravestones; but he did them all the same.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two more weeks passed before one day he walked up the path to the old section of the cemetery and realized he had cleaned and restored ever gravestone there.  He looked around at all the them and realized he had no idea how many that was; too many to count easily.  He looked down at his hands and realized they were no longer manicured.  Now the were rough and dirty and cut or scrapped up in some places.  His father had said once long ago that a woman wore her life in her eyes and a man wore his on his hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gretaâs gravestone was as always meticulously clean.  Even after backbreaking days of cleaning gravestones he finished the day checking hers for signs of wear-and-tear or dirt.  He always took his lunch with her but never cleaned hers up then; that he saved for the end of the day.  He would tell her about his work in the old section, sort of like he did when he had still had a paying job.  And she was alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat Kingston gravestone was a royal pain in the ass,â he told her.  She would have groaned at that pun.  A thought hit him then.  Had he ever really asked her about her day.  How could he not have known about the cycling club she had joined.  Or the cycling charity.  And had she done that out of some desire to do something for kids since they did not have any?  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint tried to think back through their daily interactions.   He thought he remembered asking her things.  That he could not remember clearly bothered him.  People did say sometimes he sucked the air out of the room when he entered it.  Given his job he had always taken that as a good thing until nowâ¦</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âIs there anything you want to tell me, baby?â Clint said to Gretaâs gravestone.  As soon as it came out of his mouth the ludicrousness of it made him close his eyes.  <em>Did I even know you at the end there?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDid I even know you at the end there, baby?â  And when had âthe endâ started?  This year?  Five years ago?  Ten?  <em>Was Greta not talking or was I not listening?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clintâs eyes fell on his bike helmet.  He remembered the rush of speed he felt that first day pedaling home from the cemetery.  That thrill of the world streaming past him while he threw everything he had into a singular, perpetual motion.  Was Greta trying to escape him?  The life they had built?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint mused on that for a while.  Then for the first time in weeks he went to his car, still parked in the cemeteryâs parking lot and loaded the Beast into it.  His windshield was covered in fallen leaves from where he had left it parked under a tree.  He quickly cleared them with his arm, not even noticing  that 6 months ago he would have sat in the driverâs seat trying to clear them with the wipers rather than risk dirtying his expensive clothes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he had a few stops to make first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ââââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guy was just flipping the sign closed when Clint pulled into the space in front of the bike shop.  The guy saw him, hesitated then waved him in.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI did not expect to see you again,â the guy said.  He grabbed a long rod and used it to start lowering the steel rolling doors down over the front display windows.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint handed the man the bristle brush.  The man took it and examined it.  âA little worse for the wear.  What have you been doing it it?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCleaning gravestones,â Clint replied.  He scanned the shelves and so did not notice the manâs face curdle in mild disgust.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man handed the brush back to Clint. âKeep it.â  He watched as Clint scanned the shelves.  âI take it you arenât just here to return the brush.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint nodded.  âI need supplies for a bicycling trip.â  The man started to point at a row of bike racks that could be mounted on cars, but Clint shook his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo cars.  Just the bike.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man paused at that then looked Clint up and down as if reassessing him.  âHow long a trip?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pointed to the bookâGretaâs bookâstill sitting on the shelf where the man had placed it months ago.  âHow long will it take to go everywhere Greta wanted to go in that book?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man stared at Clint for a long moment then walked over to the front door and locked it.  âThis is going to take a while,â he said.  âBut,â he said, waiving a hand across the shelves, âit wonât be cheap.  I wonât sell you anything you donât need but if you are serious there are some things you will definââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pulled a large envelope and handed it to the man.  The man leaned forward and read the letterhead on the envelope.  âAm I being served?â </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint opened the envelope and took out some folded papers.  He laid them on the counter and smoothed them out.  âThis is a trust created in Gretaâs name specifically to support her Kids on Bikes thing.â  Clint pointed to a section of the papers.  âThis names you as co-executor of the trust along with my lawyer.  And this is your annual salary for running the trust.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man leaned forward to read the section.  His mouth dropped and he swore.  âAre you screwing with me?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint continued, pointing to another section.  âMy house and car have been donated to the trust with the understanding that both will be used for the purposes of the charity.â  Clint peered down and read something.  âSo the main house is now the charityâs headquarters but you can live one of the guest houses if you choose.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOne ofâ¦?â the man said slowly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThe trust also will allow you to turn one of the guest houses and the workshop into a storefront.  But you will need to work with Bill on re-zoning that part of the property.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man was still staring dumbfounded.  âBill?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pointed to another section of the trust document.  âMy lawyer.  He is co-executor with you or rather his law firm is.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man walking awkwardly behind the counter and sat heavily on his stool.  He stared at the trust document like it was a snake.  âWe knew Greta had money butââ he looked up at Clint.  âWhy are you doing all this?  Is this what she wanted? A Last will or somethingâ¦whyâyou donât even know me.  I could be a crook!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pointed his lawyerâs name.  âIf you defraud the trust Bill will bury you under the jail.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOf course,â the man said.  âWhy else have a lawyer as co-executive on a cycling charity trust?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCo-executor,â Clint corrected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âRight,â the man said.  âI donât even knowâthis is really crazyâare youâ¦well, where are you going to be while all this is going on and Iâm running your charity and this shop and I mean where are you going to stayââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pointed at Gretaâs book on the shelf behind the manâs head.  âYou tell me.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man looked over his shoulder at the book and read the title on the spine.  âAh.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He grabbed the book and flipped through it then he handed it to Clint.  âOkay, Mr. Money Bagsââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou can just call me âMoney Bagsâ,â Clint interrupted then smiled slightly.  âI know this is crazy.  All of this.â  He pointed at the trust document towards the end.  âAnd so is this.  It says someone from the charity had to go and clean up Gretaâs gravestone.  Move the leaves and check for cracks.  I have a checklist and also directions in the addendum.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man shrugged.  âThatâs an easy one.  Everybody loved Greta.  There will be a line out the door of volunteers for that one.  Any other hidden gems in there.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shook his head.  âMost of my money went in the trust.  So if you would take it easy on the price of cycling supplies and maybe help me find a second hand tent I would appreciate it.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man laughed out loud.  He smacked his knee.  âMoney Bags, I have got you covered there.  You are going to be my cycling masterpiece.  Light, fast yet able to handle any emergency or speed bump life throws at you.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man proved to be as good as his word.  Clint had never seen so many gadgets that could be compactly stored yet were clearly amazingly useful.  The man even called a few other store owners and cycling enthusiasts and had them come to bring various cycling gear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It quickly turned into a free-for-all and a party.  After the third argument between the cycling enthusiasts and store owners on the merits of tires for the beast Clint walked across the street to the convenience store to pick up a few cases of beer and sandwiches for the motley group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took most of the night and at one point Clint fell asleep on the portable mattress inside the collapsible tent someone had brought for his new life.  By the time dawn came a bleary-eyed group led by the man unzipped the tent and peaked in.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs ready,â the man said in a slightly hushed voice.  The group stepped back to let Clint exit the tent.  Someone handed him a breakfast sandwich and a small bottle of orange juice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint followed the group into the back room.  His bike, âthe beastâ was sitting in the middle of the floor.  It had saddle bags and what looked like new, slightly thicker tires.  At first, Clint thought those were the only changes until he realized the group had actually designed, welded and painted a sort of strength reinforcements for some of the bars of the bike.  If Clint had not been familiar with the bike he would have never even noticed it but they were thicker than he remembered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPick it up,â the man said and Clint did.  It was not much heavier than he was used to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhat are the things on the bars you made for?â he asked.  âExtra stability?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked up to see the group smiling as one.  âThose arenât covers,â the bike shop owner said with a smirk.  âThat is your whole freakinâ life rolled up in a series of hidden compartments.  The saddle bags will carry some stuff but that shit isâwell, weâll show you.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âJust him and the road,â one of the cyclists said with more than a little longing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFree,â another said wistfully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYou are going to make Inspector Gadget look like a Class A amateur,â the man said.  âWatch this.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jack was in insurance and he looked like it. His frame was narrow, his face was framed by gold wire glasses that sat atop a pointed nose and his hair was neat and trim balding at the top. He looked severe and serious and he could pull the laughter out of the air with terse remarks and often did. The kitchen was his, though Michael could easily have believed he only ate the little circles of paper left behind from his three hole punch. Every utensil matched and aligned the wall on unfashionable hooks surrounding a old plain and perfectly clean stove. The room was all white and the counters pale gray, a crumb or speck of food could not hide. Margret had the dining room and it was inverse the kitchen, ornate messy and disorganized. Boxes of magazines covered the table and the room was painted a dark green. The light in the room was a chandelier and was always set to a dim glow. There was a window, but whatever chance sunlight had to brighten the room was stymied by thick ornate purple curtains. It was here Michael saw Margret spending most of here time. She pulled the telephone of the wall and chatted with her sister at the table while thumbing through magazines. Apparently the same ones here sister was looking at because she frequently said "what do you think about page 42?" Or "I think mama would like him he looks kind". Margret spoke in a whisper and seemed meek even to, what was he now? Nine year old. Like he could walk in and tell her to wash his clothes and not out of kindness but obedience she would capitulate. When she wasn't looking through magazines she would come and sit with Ellory and Michael while they played. Most times she didn't join in, she would come and hug Ellory and kiss her forehead three times then go and sit and watch. "That's very nice" she would say as Michael Ellory and Lily, a little girl who was Ellory neighbor, played house or sailed an imaginary ship. Jack sometimes strode through playtime murmuring and head down. Going back, Jack scared Michael more than he did when he was a kid. This time the fear was of being him, pushing past things worth revisiting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint looked around the barracks.  The guys were passing around the pictures he had of his beast.  One in âtraveling formâ and one in âcamping formâ with all the bells and whistles on display.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint understood their expressions.  That bike was a work of art made by a group of people making their Magnum Opus.  Those pictures were reminders that there was such a thing as beauty in the world.  And art.  That people could love something so much and that love could be transferred somehow into it; enmeshed in a design and modification of the already amazing work of engineering and efficiency that the beast started as.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What that group did to the beast made the word âcustomâ sound like gutter profanity.  Art was the closest thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLike the first day you found out you were a dad and before you had a chance to screw it all up,â Porno Dan said when he looked at the photos.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaner just grunted and passed the photos on without even a glance.  Clint never had a read on that guy.  The grunt could mean he liked them or hated them or was just hungry.  Like everyone else Clint avoided Beaner.  Clint had never seen a shark up close but the dull grey eyes that watched him now made him feel like he was swimming with one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGoing to be lights out soon,â the captain said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint nodded and took a deep breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âFor a long time I just rode,â he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a long time, Clint just rode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the beginning, he followed Gretaâs book.  She did not have a lot mapped out but he took every road and trail she had highlighted; stopped at every spot she had circled or written about in the margins in her careful neat handwriting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> He spent hours at each stop, staring around, trying to determine what had fascinated herâor rather, he realized one day during breakfast as he was breaking campâwhat <em>would have </em>fascinated herâ¦or maybe would not have.  That was the problem with trying to walk forward in someone elseâs footsteps or walk a path intended for two people by yourself: you couldnât.  No path ever remained as intended.  At any point they might have just decided together to go off their previously intended path.  That is all a map really isâa list of possibilities that you have sketched out a goal and the best way to get to it on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint had gone back through the entire book that morning while he sipped his coffee.  He committed all of it to memory; every map, every handwritten note, every short blurb the author had written.  More than once as he flipped the pages he had grumbled, remembering some small inaccuracies on the map.  He wrote in his own notes and corrections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A young couple had been camping a few sites down from his.  He had only been there for the night; riding in right as the sun was setting.  The beast had done its little bag of tricks and belched out from its hidden compartments his tent and other supplies.  No one had been camped within earshot of them and within a few hours of sunset he understood why: they were either on some sort of honeymoon or doing research for a how-to book on every sexual position known to manâand triple checking their work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint had placed the book in a plastic bag and left it quietly outside the coupleâs tent.  Inside, on the cover page, he had written: <em>This book has a lot of good places for a couple to go together.  Thanks and Good Luck, Clint and Greta</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Clint went off-map.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âLetâs go back to the couple at the campsite for a second,â Slappy said, interrupting Clint.  âWhat, ahââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGravestones,â Beaner said, in his soft whisper of a voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone in the barracks looked at Slappy then at Beaner.  Slappy looked for a few seconds like he might argue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âGravestones,â Beaner said again, a little louder.  It sounded like a knife being scrapped over a whetstone.  Slappy shut his mouth and the captain motioned for Clint to continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThat,â Clint said, âstarted a few weeks later.  I rode and rode and then one day I was sitting at this little cafe eating.  I saw a graveyard across the street.  I wandered over there, thinking about Gretaâs grave and remembering the old ones near herâs that I had cleaned up.  This was an old graveyard, too, but not large like Gretaâs place.  Looked more like a small family site.  Everything there was at least 150 to 200 years old.  All of them were in bad shape.  So I camped there a week or two and cleaned them up, memorized them for later and rode on.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNext place I stopped had something like that near there, too, so I did the same thing.  And just kept going from there.â  Clint reached under his cot and pulled out his rucksack.  He opened it and slid a small bound notebook out.  He handed it to Triple Dub, the companyâs mechanic.  He was a short man but thickly built which somehow made him look taller.  He was the companyâs unofficial Mother Hen; watching over everyone elseâs mental healthâor what was left of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dub opened it and whistled.  He flipped through a few pages then turned it around and showed one of the pages to the others.  It was charcoal drawing of a gravestone, expertly rendered.  Something had been done to the page to make it waterproof.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Triple Dub handed it on to the next guy.  âHow many graves did you draw, brother?â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint opened the rucksack and dumped it on his cot.  Nine other notebooks slid out.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThis is front and back of the page,â Headroom said.  He showed the room, flipping a pages so everyone could see.  Clint nodded and handed the rest of the notebooks out to a few guys who began flipping through them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI would ride from town to town or sometimes just see stones in the distance off the road and go over and camp by them.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo one ever stopped you?â The captain asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shrugged.  âI got some strange looks from time to time, but no one ever bothered me.  I just kept riding and stopping and cleaning them up.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo,â Flenderson said, âyouâre not here for kid and youâre not in a TV show like Hollywood.  Youâre running from a bunch of angry, one-nightstand widows?â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flenderson was a big man and one of the companyâs small arms experts.  He was as always bristling with weapons, even here in the barracks.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint chuckled.  âNo widows, though there were a few stops where it took me a little longer to get that job done because I got wrapped up inâ¦other things.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple guys laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âBut none of them were as good asâ¦â Clint gestured to the barracks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSlappyâs mother,â everyone said in unison.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âScrew you, guys,â Slappy said automatically without looking up from the notebook he was flipping through.  It was an old inside joke that even he had forgotten the origins of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo,â the captain said, smiling.  âSlappy is denying youâre a Gerry for him.â  Then his smile dropped.  âWhy are you really here?â</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA['He wants to fuck me, I am sure of it' says the beautiful waitress.

'How do you know?' I asked, knowing she had fucked him eleven times.

'He asks me to stay behind and regales me with how my bullshit essay was soo impressive. I wrote it hungover and just sort of filled in between my standard opening, transition and closer." She said grabbing a fry off my plate. The bartender looked over and scowled.

'firstly, how do you know your not a genius? We may infer that you could be, you are in law school and a great pianist. Lastly I can conclude you are a genius and that is why your professor was amazed with your paper.' I posited, you always look like you are opening a present when you are being complimented.

'psssh, the thing is I am smart enough to know that you are right, I am above average, but that same smartness makes me aware that the only people who care to comment on it want to bang me.' The waitress says leaning close. The bartender walked up as I stared into your eyes, even if they weren't really your eyes. 'Hey Bridgett, got a minute, I have a quick question for you about table ten.' He would have said, but he didn't say anything. He gazed off looking at the tv. 'Yes, I will take two Heinekens' I say to him, 'It's on the house' he says, or remembers saying.

'your doing your thing aren't you? The hypnosis' she says. Maybe I should have told you what it really is. We could be so close. I make her forget the drinks. She stares off.

'Any way I think I may let Professor compliments get lucky. I have heard his final is a huge pain'.

'Yeah? You don't think it could get complicated?' I ask musingly. Originally I said that it was a bad idea and unethical. She didn't like that and she yelled at me and told me I just needed someone to fuck. This time she pondered, winked and said 'perhaps'.

She suits your directness and at times I can forget she isn't you. It makes me feel guilty and sick, but I like it.

Sometimes I think about leaving her this way, your thoughts nestled in her head. She doesn't really like her boyfriend and she cheats on him with people from dating apps. Maybe Bridgette needs a little time out. I would have to line up a dozen people and pull a lot of memories if I wanted to keep her for a while. There are three different patrons who come in just to see her and her boyfriend and all her coworkers and her ever present and supportive mother. But those are just excuses. The real reason is she isn't you and also she is. I hold all your memories so I can put them into whoever. I can make your Dad Elvis and Mother a kind nun. You will have fond memories of your nun mother gently brushing your hair. But fuck, me and you? We are stuck with what happened. It's sticky, all balled up into a mess I can't untangle or break anything free from. My guess is I can't tell what's your memory or mine. Did you think I was an unattractive nuisance or did I? Maybe both. I always go to pieces around you. That makes the most sense, I can pull and push memories but I can't create. And I can't just take someone else and put you in the same memory. I mean I literally cannot. It's interesting, both the memories and my inability to change them make me feel powerless.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint tapped his wire-bristle brush against the base of the gravestone.  It was not the one from the bike store; that one had worn out a long time back.  This one was wearing thin to Clint noticed.  Most of his supplies were.  He would have to pick up more in the next town he stopped in.  He was camped beside a small family graveyard, long since forgotten.  There was nothing around for miles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A loud screech followed by a crash made Clint jerk around.  A carâs horn was blaring.  Clint looked down the hill, near the road he could see a car flipped on its side.  He hesitated for a moment, staring in horror, then took off running in the direction of the sound. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a steep incline but Clint traversed it easily, barely noticing the slippery grade.  As he got closer he could see that the car had slid to a stop in the ditch, tearing up a swath of dirt behind it all the way to the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint circled around to the front of the car so he could see into the windshield.  A man was hanging to the side, secured by his seatbelt.  His forehead was covered in blood where he had apparently smashed it into the steering wheel or maybe hit it some other way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man was clawing at his seatbelt.  Clint considered climbing up onto the side of the car to get to the man but realized his weight might topple the car.  Then the man would be upside down and Clint would probably end up under it.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He put his hands on the roof and braced his feet on the side of the ditch.   Clint pushed with all of his might.  Countless hours of cycling had given him strength in his legs, but still it was difficult.  Beforeâin his flabby middle aged lifeâhe would have never been able to shift the car even slightly.  Now, as he heaved and pushed the car began to shift.  Clint flipped over and put his back against the roof and pushed off with his legs.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The car shifted slowly towards its tipping point then fell heavily onto its wheels.  Clint fell to the ground and rolled away instinctively but the car had settled back on its wheels with a heavy thud.  Clint stood and rushed around to the driver side door.  He pulled it open and knelt down to release the manâs seatbelt.  The manâs head lolled forward and for a second Clint thought he might already be dead but then the man turned his head slightly so that he could see Clint.  His hand came up shakily and pointed at his throat.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint looked closer and noticed the blood slowly seeping out of a wound.  Clint cursed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHold on!â Clint said.  He took off his shirt and pressed it against the manâs neck.  As he did he noticed the enormous amount of blood already staining the manâs shirt and trousers.  The wound in the manâs neck was not a slow wound there just apparently was not much blood left to come out of the man.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man pointed again at his wound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âItâs bad,â Clint said.  The man nodded and pointed again.  Clint looked and saw partially stained by blood was a small folded piece of paper poking out of the manâs shirt pocket.  Clint took it carefully, trying to keep pressure on the wound at the same time.  He shook the page out until it unfolded enough for him to read it.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI need myââ Clint started to say then noticed the symbol at the top of the page.  Clint had been out of the world for a while but he recognized the symbol.  He looked at the manâs wound again.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWellâ¦â Clint said slowly then cursed softly.  The man tried to mouth something.  Clint leaned in close and the man whispered again.  Clint leaned back and stared at the man.  The man tried to reach towards Clint but his movements were sluggish and clumsy.  Clint took the manâs hand delicately and shook it once.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOkay,â he said.  âYes.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The barracks was quiet, most of the Gerries watching Clint, some staring off into the distance.  The captain was pacing slowly.  He paused in front of Clint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOn the piece of paper?â The captain asked though Clint and every man in the room knew the answer already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHis Gerrie papers,â Clint said.  âThree boys.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âSo youâre real name is not even Bill Clay, is it?â Frisco said.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint smiled wanly and shook his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhen weâre you going to tell us all this?â Dan asked, irritated.  âWe are pretty much your brothers now, arenât we?  And it sounds like weâre actually the only version of family youâve got!â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWhy do you edit your kidâs letters and send them back, PD?â Clint asked </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI donât edit hisâtheyâre not letters, theyâreâ¦â Dan trailed off.  âHe least heâs really my kid.  You donât even writeâ¦â Dan sat back on his bunk suddenly as the realization hit him.  âBecause they would recognize that your hand writing is not their dadâs.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain stared pacing again then he stopped and turned to the Clint.  âSo how did you get here?  I mean pass the genetics tests?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shrugged.  âI had enough of the guyâs blood and I cut off some hair with some medical scissors I had.  I cleaned out the car and then burned it.  And I was already at a graveyard no one visited so I dug up the fourth oldest one I could find and buried him on top of what was left of the coffin.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âWas there a skeleton down there?â Frisco asked.  âIn the coffin?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI assume so,â Clint said.  He leaned back on his bunk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âDoesnât add up,â Beaner rasped from across the room.  He was standing by the door, looking out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The captain nodded.  âI agree.  Even if you had his blood and hair there is no way you could make it past all the tests and interviews.â  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint closed his eyes.  âIt took me two days to ride to the town.  Two days straight, no stops.  I walked him handed them the paper and the guyâs hair sample and introduced myself under his name.  It was that simple.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint pulled up outside of the Recruiting station two days later.  He was dirty with road dust and dirt from the grave he had dug up to bury the man.  He was still wearing the now dried, blood-soaked shirt he had used to try to staunch the flow of the guyâs blood.  The on-duty sergeant looked him up and down after scanning Clintâs Gerrie recruiting letter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âI hit a deer,â Clint said, answering the questioning look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant looked past Clint at the Beast, chained to a sign in the parking lot.  âOn that,â he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âYes,â Clint said simply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âOn a bicycle?â the man said incredulously.  âYou hit a deer on a bicycle and it did this,â he gestured at Clintâs clothes and dirty-covered arms, âto you?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant nodded.  âOkay.  You have any other form of ID?â  Clint handed him the dead manâs ID. </p>

<p>The sergeant looked back and forth between Clint and the picture on the ID.  âYou know that itâs a feloââ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âCan I make a call on your phone?â Clint asked, cutting him off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant nodded.  Clint picked up the phone and dialed.  After a moment, he said, âDale?  Hi, this is Clint.  I need you to make a call for me.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took about an hour but eventually the sergeantâs phone rang as Clint knew it would.  The sergeant answered it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âThis isâuh, yes, sir, yes, uh, yes.â  The sergeant looked over at Clint.  âHe is right here across the desk from me.â  The sergeant listened.  âSir, would be a bit unorthoâ¦um, yes, sir, I understand butââ He held the phone out and looked at it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âHe just hung up,â the sergeant said to Clint.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âPower politics,â Clint said.  âTell them what you want without explicitly stating it.  Make sure they understand the directive.  Hang up before they have a chance to second guess or argue.  Did he call you by your first name or some derivative of it?  A short or slang form of your name?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant looked slightly shaken.  âNo, why?â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âNo reason,â Clint said.  âCall it professional curiosity.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant put the hair samples in small tube and sealed it.  He took a label off of a form and applied it to the side.  He spoke as he worked.  âI have processed three Gerries since I got posted here.  Four now with you.  To a man you have been bat-shit crazy.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He dropped the ID Clint had taken off the dead man into a shredder by his desk and watched as it was turned into small pieces.  Then he turned the form towards Clint.  âSign at the bottom,â he said then looked down at the form.  âActuallyâ¦â. He scribbled something illegible on the line and then stuck his finger in a cup of cold coffee sitting on the desk beside him.  He rubbed his finger over where he had just scribbled.  He looked at the page, nodded then stood up.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He held out a hand to Clint.  âWelcome to the Gerries, Bill Clay.â  Clint shook his hand.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>âMister,â the sergeant said, âSomeone must really want you dead.â</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clint shrugged.  âI know where all the bodies are buried.â Then the irony of the statement hit him and he laughed out loud.  âWell, not all but quiet a few,â he said, smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sergeant smiled uncomfortably.  âTo a man,â he said softly.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">I donât remember being in the drunken drama teachers class. To be clear she wasnât currently drunk, just frequently. Her class looked disorganized from the outside, but there was some order the kids themselves imposed. Little cliques at different stations of drama and some musical activity but mostly it was open discussion.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You arenât supposed to be in here Ms. Mastly said to me from behind her desk, not in a commanding teacherly way but more of a co-conspirator friendly way.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âMr. S said he could be in here.â Ellory defended calmly, there were at least two others with equally unlikely alibis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âOk, Iâll write him a noteâ Ms. Mastly said with a wink.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael had just arrived enough to be able to talk, but he was still wobbly. The anchor he had chosen was Zebâs body spray, it was not a specific anchor but Michael figured if he thought about the day zeb wore a top hat that might work. Michael didnât know that Zeb hadnât worn the top hat as part of the same phase so Michael landed somewhere in between those two waves of Zebâs personal inspiration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âAnd freeze!â Tiny Alison said, jumping up to tap Michael on the shoulder. Ah freeze, a game where actors would play out a scenario, I got it.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âThat was a good impersonation of a drunk person Michael, the zoo would be a curious, maybe fun place to get drunk, I like the interpretationâ TA said pulling up her capris from kids, maybe baby Gap. She took a severe pose and started into an Australian accent as Michael sat down next to Ellory.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âShe is fierce, I would hate to be that alligatorâ Michael said watching TA tackle Mark Kirstead and hold his mouth shut with her small hands.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">âYeah she I taught her that moveâ Ellory said in an admiring way âI said wanna see how to make someone shut up?â Ellory giggled. I leaned back in my chair and surveyed the class. Some students were writing in the corner. Jonathan was playing a keyboard next to a group practicing stomp dancing. Then there was our clique, Zeb, TA, Mark and Ellory. Zeb was playing a newscaster and was narrating the Australians struggle as she put an alligator into a choke hold.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know Ms. Mastly would soon be fired for attacking a student verbally over âtakingâ Allison Robynâs boyfriend. The word âslutâ and âhussyâ were used and the old term that I am still uncertain of itâs meaning or pertinence âyellow belliedâ. But there was a certain quality about Ms. Mastly, students could really be themselves around her. She would hug crying students and cuss around them, âyeah you have been through some shitâ she would say. She would talk about her adult troubles and prepare them for when they too would be kicked out of a chiliâs for heckling patrons. I think today was one of her good days, she was doing some do ray me warm up over the roar of classroom conversation and I think one maybe or two students were following along.Â Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellory Had her hair braided into a short little rope and pulled the end through a gray baseball cap. She watched Zeb pointing to Allison dropping an elbow on mark and winced a little as she landed, small though she was. Michael extended his hand and brushed Ellory's thumb. Her ears flushed and she kept looking forward. Michael ran his finger along hers and she returned the motion.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to be there when Papi passes, but I donât have time. I have been so foolish to not examine the limitations of what I discovered. And I want to be there for you, and I will perhaps in some form. I am realizing the gift more and more as it goes. But I can be here now.Â  Michael took Ellory's hand in his. Emotions donât always come in order and I think people unlearn that.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to accept the thought of losing you. I saw a documentary onc about pompeii, amidst the preserved ruins they found graffiti on a wall. Roughly translated it read âGaius Pumidius Diphilus was here.â It was nice, seeing something relatable made me feel as if some small notion was flung forth escaping the lurking doom. I am here Ellory, not forever but right now. I hope that counts.Â </span>]]></content:encoded>
